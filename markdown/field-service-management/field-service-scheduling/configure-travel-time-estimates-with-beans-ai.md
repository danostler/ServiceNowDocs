# Configure travel time estimates with Beans.ai

Use the Beans.ai, the map provider that Schedule Optimization supports for more accurate travel time estimates.

## Before you begin

A connection and credential for Beans.ai must have been established. For more information, see [Set up a connection and credential for Beans.ai travel estimate provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/create-a-connection-and-credential-for-beans-ai.md).

Role required: wm\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Map Integrations for Field Service** &gt; **Travel Time Estimate Configuration** &gt; **All**

2.  Select **New**.

    **Note:** Beans.ai operates on a bring your own license \(BYOL\) licensing model. If Beans.ai isn’t configured, travel estimates default to straight-line.

3.  On the form, provide a name for the travel time estimate provider and an optional description.

4.  In the **Select a travel estimate provider** field, select Beans.ai.

5.  Ensure that the travel time estimate is calculated and updated continuously by selecting the **Enable real-time** check box.

6.  Select **Submit**.

7.  Adjust travel for specific times of day by adding travel band modifiers.

    **Note:** Travel bands can vary in duration, ranging from 30 minutes to 4 hours, and can't overlap.

    1.  Select an existing Beans.ai record.

    2.  Scroll down to the **Travel Band Modifiers** tab.

    3.  Select **New**.

    4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

Multiplier

</td><td>

A numerical factor applied to the base travel time to increase travel time to adjust for predicted higher traffic or other conditions during the specified time range.If the multiplier is greater than 1, it increases travel time. For example, a multiplier of 1.2 increases travel time by 120%.

Use a multiplier less than 1 to decrease travel time for off-peak hours when travel is faster than normal. For example, a multiplier of 0.8 reduces travel time by 80%.

When selected, sends the travel band's day and time window to the map provider to return a travel time estimate based on historical traffic data for that period.
