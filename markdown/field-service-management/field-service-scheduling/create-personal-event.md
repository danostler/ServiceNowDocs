# Show that an agent is busy with a personal event

Block time on agent calendars for events that aren’t related to work orders.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_dispatcher

## About this task

Dispatchers can use non-work order personal events to show an agent is busy. For example, if an agent is in training all day, you can use a personal event to show an agent is busy on the calendar in Dispatcher Workspace.

For information on editing or deleting personal events, see [Edit or delete a personal event](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/edit-delete-event.md).

**Note:** You can't create recurring personal events.

## Procedure
