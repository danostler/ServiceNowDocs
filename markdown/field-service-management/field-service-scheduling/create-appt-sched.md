# Create an Appointment schedule

An appointment schedule represents available slots as defined by its appointment window and service mapping configurations. Appointment schedules can be overridden for specific dates or slots to allow custom availability or capacity.

## Before you begin

Role required: appointment\_booking\_admin

Ensure that the Advanced Appointment Booking plugin is active. For more information, see [Activate Advanced Appointment Booking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/activate-adv-appt-booking.md).

Ensure you have already created an **Appointment Window** and a **Service configuration mapping**.

## About this task

An appointment schedule defines available time slots based on its configuration. You can also create an appointment schedule override to customize availability for specific dates or time slots. For more information on overrides, see [Create an Appointment Schedule Override](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/create-appt-sched-override.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Appointment Booking** &gt; **Appointment schedule**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

4.  |Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Service configuration mapping|The service configuration mapping that contains the type of service and territory for the schedule. For more information, see [Create an Appointment service configuration mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/create-appt-svc-config-mapping.md).|
|Appointment window configuration|The appointment window configuration that contains the duration, break, and slot intervals. For more information, see [Create an Appointment window configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/field-service-management/field-service-scheduling/create-appt-window-config.md).|

|End date|End date of the appointment schedule.|
|Order|Value that determines the priority or sequence for the configuration. The lesser the value, the greater the priority.|
|Number of appointments|Number of available appointments for each configured appointment time slot. This number determines the number of available appointments that are displayed on the Select Appointment window.|
