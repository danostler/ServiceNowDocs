# Customize pop over fields on the calendar in Dispatcher Workspace

Add or remove the fields that show in Dispatcher Workspace pop overs so more relevant information is easier for dispatchers to find.

## Before you begin

Role required: wm\_admin

## About this task

**Warning:** Only developers with a high level of experience using JavaScript should perform this procedure.

Using JavaScript along with a script includes, you can show different values than the default information that is shown in the pop over window. The default fields in the pop over information are:

-   **Short description**: A short description of the work order task
-   **Number**: The work order task number
-   **Scheduled start**
-   The **Assignment group**
-   **Location**: The location of the work order task

The following image shows that the **Assigned to** field has been added to the pop over window to indicate who the work order task is assigned to.

\[Omitted image "modified\_popover.png"\] Alt text: Modified pop over with the Assigned to field added

5.  Select and copy the entire `getCalendarEventTooltipDetails` function.

6.  Return to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Script Includes**.

8.  Paste the `getCalendarEventTooltipDetails` function into the `DispatcherWorkspaceCalendarBrokerImpl` record beneath where it says `//Add / override customizations here.`.
