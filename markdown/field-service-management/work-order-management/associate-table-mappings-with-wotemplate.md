1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Field Service** &gt; **Template Management** &gt; **Attribute Mapping**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Table map|Name of the mapping stored in the CSM table map.|
    |Order model|Name of the work order template for which you want to use the table-mapping configurations.|

4.  Select **Submit**.
