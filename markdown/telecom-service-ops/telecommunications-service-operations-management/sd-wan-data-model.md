# SD-WAN data model

The ServiceNow AI Platform® uses a custom data model that defines how SD-WAN connectors discover and retrieve device information.

The ServiceNow AI Platform® integrates with three SD-WAN service providers: [Cisco Meraki](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/telecom-service-ops/telecommunications-service-operations-management/configuring-cisco-meraki-service-graph-connector.md), [Fortinet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/telecom-service-ops/telecommunications-service-operations-management/configure-fortinet-service-graph-connector.md), and VeloCloud.

The SD-WAN data model defines the structure of an SD-WAN network by documenting classes, their relationships, and comprehensive details about network assets, including configuration data, available ports, and bandwidth allocations across sites and services. This enables centralized management of SD-WAN repositories, streamlined provisioning and monitoring, and efficient resource allocation for building and maintaining network infrastructure.

## ServiceNow AI Platform® SD-WAN data model architecture

The following table describes the entities used in the SD-WAN architecture and the classes to which they belong.
