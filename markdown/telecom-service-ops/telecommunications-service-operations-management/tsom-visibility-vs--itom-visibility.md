# Telecom Visibility vs. ITOM Visibility

As telecom networks evolve and become more hybrid and complex, visibility into infrastructure is more critical than ever. To meet the unique needs of different environments, ServiceNow AI Platform offers two purpose-built visibility solutions: ITOM Visibility and Telecom Visibility.

While they’re built on the same foundation, each is tailored to serve a different world—ITOM for traditional IT infrastructure and TSOM for telecom networks.

Both ITOM Visibility and Telecom Visibility are built on the same underlying capabilities of the ServiceNow Discovery engine, Identification and Reconciliation Engine \(IRE\), and CMDB. They both provide:

-   Agent-based and agentless discovery.
-   Horizontal and pattern-based discovery.
-   Reconciliation of discovered data into CMDB.
-   Dependency mapping and CI relationship creation.
-   Integration with the Discovery Admin Workspace and CMDB 360.

Despite this shared architecture, the scope, use cases, and data models they serve are different.

## Key differences between TSOM and ITOM Visibility

|Feature / Focus Area|ITOM Visibility|Telecom Visibility|
|--------------------|---------------|------------------|
|Target Environment|Traditional IT infrastructure \(servers, applications, databases, cloud resources\)|Telecom infrastructure \(xNFs, network elements, EMS/NMS controllers\)|
|Discovery Method|Horizontal Discovery with IT patterns|Horizontal Discovery with Telecommunications Discovery Patterns \(SNMP/CLI\) and Service Graph Connectors for telecom|
|CMDB Model|ITOM CMDB classes \(for example, Windows Server, Application, Network Adapter\)|Telecom-aware CMDB classes and Telecom Network Inventory \(TNI\) \(for example, Interface Cards, Slots, LAGs, Subslots, VLANs\)|
|Plugins required|com.snc.discovery and com.snc.itom.visibility|sn\_tsom\_core, sn\_tsom\_patterns, and telecom-specific SGC plugins \(for example, sn\_sgc\_altiplano\_connector\)|
|Use Case Focus|Application dependency mapping, service modeling, cloud infrastructure discovery|Telecom network inventory discovery, reconciliation, autonomous network operations|
|Discrepancy Handling|General IRE reconciliation rules|Telecom-specific discrepancy identification and reconciliation \(for example, hierarchy mismatches, attribute-level conflicts\)|
|Vendor Data Ingestion|Primarily via discovery patterns|Strong emphasis on northbound API integrations using SGCs \(EMS/NMS/controllers\)|
|Network Types Supported|Enterprise networks, datacenters, cloud|Multi-vendor, multi-domain telecom networks \(RAN, Core, Transport, Access\)|

## Infographic

The following infographic helps you understand the differences between TSOM and ITOM Visibility.

## Key benefits

Use ITOM Visibility when:

-   You’re discovering IT infrastructure components \(for example, Windows servers, cloud VMs, databases, load balancers\).
-   Your primary goals include service mapping, operational resilience, or cloud optimization.
-   You’re focusing on ITSM, ITOM, or DevOps use cases.

Use Telecom Visibility when:

-   You’re discovering telecom network infrastructure, including devices not managed by traditional IT systems.
-   You are dealing with telecom-specific network hierarchies like cards, ports, subslots, and LAGs.
-   You rely on EMS/NMS/controllers as authoritative data sources.
-   You need discrepancy detection and reconciliation tailored for telecom inventory models.
-   You are aligning with TM Forum standards, supporting autonomous network operations, or enabling closed-loop assurance.

</table>While ITOM Visibility and Telecom Visibility both serve to populate and maintain an accurate CMDB, they are optimized for different domains. ITOM Visibility is geared toward enterprise IT environments, while Telecom Visibility is tailored for the specialized needs of telecom infrastructure discovery, discrepancy management, and inventory reconciliation.

Choosing the right visibility solution—or using both in tandem—confirms that you maintain trusted, domain-specific operational visibility across both IT and telecom landscapes.
