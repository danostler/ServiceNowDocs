# Request a clone \(legacy\)

Request a clone to copy data from a production instance to a non-production instance or to copy data between non-production instances.

## Before you begin

Role required: clone\_admin

Starting with the Australia release, clone requests are no longer deployed, enhanced, or supported on the legacy page. Requests that are initiated via the legacy page `clone_instance.do` don't show up on the new clone console home page. However, they can still be found on the legacy clone history page `clone_instance_list.do`.

**Note:**

Configure your target instance before requesting your clone. See [Register target instance \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-platform-administration/t_CreateACloneTarget.md).

Configure a clone profile. See [Create a custom clone profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-platform-administration/configure-clone-profile.md).

For self-hosted customer instances that use an Oracle database, see [https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb\_article\_view&amp;sysparm\_article=KB0563847](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0563847).

## About this task

The ServiceNow AI Platform uses data from the most recent, daily backup of the source instance when cloning. Backups that are used for cloning are a maximum of 36 hours old. The initial preparation begins, including selecting the latest backup to use, only at the date and time processing is scheduled to start.

## Procedure

1.  Log in to the instance that you want to clone.

    This instance becomes the source instance of the clone request.

2.  [Register target instance \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-platform-administration/t_CreateACloneTarget.md) record for each target instance that you want to receive clone data.

3.  Verify the list of tables that are excluded from cloning and [add or remove tables to exclude](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-platform-administration/t_ExcludeATableFromCloning.md) from the target instance.

4.  Verify the list of tables and system properties that you want saved on the target instance with the following.

5.  Navigate to **Instance clone** &gt; **Request Clone**.

6.  Specify a predefined clone profile.

    A clone profile stores target and clone options. The clone profile automatically populates your clone request with your selected profile settings. See [clone profiles for clone requests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-platform-administration/system-profile-clone.md).

7.  In the **Target instance** field, select the target instance that you want to receive the cloned data.

    Create a separate clone request for each target instance that you want to receive clone data.

8.  In the **Clone Scheduled Start Time** field, select the time that you want the cloning to start.

    You can schedule multiple clone requests for the same source instance. For example, create a clone request to copy data to non-production instance A and another clone request to copy data to non-production instance B. The scheduling engine determines whether multiple clone requests against the same source instance can occur simultaneously or whether they must occur sequentially. If your source instance is large, see clone chaining on [Exploring Instance Clone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-platform-administration/exploring-instance-clone.md).

    The system verifies the scheduled start time and either accepts the date-time value that you selected or suggests an available date-time value. The validation process helps prevent scheduling conflicts with other automations using the same target instance.

9.  In the **Email upon completion** field, enter your email address so that you can receive alerts after the cloning finishes, is canceled, or has an error.

10. Select the **Options** arrowhead so that it turns downward.

11. Fill in your options.

12. Select **Submit**.

    If there are no issues with the clone request, the system displays the Authenticate Target modal.

13. Enter the user name and password for an administrator account on the target instance and then select **Authenticate**.

14. Review the clone settings and select **OK**.

    An email is sent to the supplied address after the clone finishes, is canceled, or has an error.
