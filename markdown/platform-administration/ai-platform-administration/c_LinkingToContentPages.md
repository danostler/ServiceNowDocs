# Content page links in email notifications

Links to CMS pages can be put in notifications to make it easy for the reader to access the pages.

The link takes the following format: **$\{CMS\_URI+&lt;site&gt;/&lt;page&gt;\}**.

For example, to link the email recipient to a page called Incident in the content site ESS, with the current incident as the target document, use the following format: **$\{CMS\_URI+ess/incident\_detail\}**

The resulting email URL has this format: `https://<instance name>.service-now.com/ess/incident_detail.do?sysparm_document_key=incident,46e18c0fa9fe19810066a0083f76bd56`
