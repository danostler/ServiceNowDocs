# Schedule recurring clones \(legacy\)

Schedule recurring clones to keep your cloned instances up to date.

## Before you begin

Role required: clone\_admin

## About this task

Instead of manually cloning instances, you can schedule cloning that happens automatically. You create a cloning schedule in the same interface that you use to [create a clone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-platform-administration/t_StartAClone.md). This topic assumes that you created a clone but not a cloning schedule for it.

## Procedure

1.  Select **Instance Clone** &gt; **Active Clones** &gt; **&lt;one-of-your-clones&gt;**.

2.  If the Options panel isn't displayed, select the **Options** arrowhead so it turns downward.

    The **Options** panel appears.

3.  A target instance must be selected or an error message appears.

4.  Select the **Conflict calendar** to view a calendar with the current clone time and potential conflicts if you want to schedule for a different time.

    The conflict calendar appears in a new tab.\[Omitted image "schedule-conflict-calendar-new.png"\] Alt text: The schedule conflict calendar.

5.  Enter values in the following fields to schedule automatic clones.

</table>6.  Select **Submit**.

    The system displays the **Authenticate Target** modal.

7.  Enter the **Username** and **Password** for an administrator account on the target instance and select **Authenticate**.

8.  To see the cloning schedule for this target, select the **Recurring Clones** tab.

    Each line in the list shows a separate, scheduled cloning session.

9.  To see log messages for past clones on this target, select the **Clone Log** tab.

10. To see cloning schedules for all the clones in the system, select **Instance Clone** &gt; **Live Clones** &gt; **Clone History**.

    The **Instance Clones** page lists all the cloning instances in the system along with their scheduled clones.


-   **[Cancel clone schedules \(legacy\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-platform-administration/modify-cloning-schedule.md)**  
Scheduled clones aren't able to be modified, you must cancel scheduled clones and make a new clone schedule.
