# Territories assigned

Territories are assigned to locations, and are not assigned directly to users.

A user's territory, and so the user's E.164-compliant phone functionality, is based on the user's location. For example, if a user has a location of **SHS quadra 5, Bloco E., Brasilia** defined in the User \[sys\_user\] table, the parent record for Brazil in the location table defines the phone territory. The phone territory may be assigned at any level of the Map pages hierarchy, which is searched going up to the next parent until the territory is found or no parents remain.
