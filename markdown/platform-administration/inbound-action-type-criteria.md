# Criteria for matching email to inbound actions

The system matches incoming email to the conditions of the active inbound actions.

The default inbound actions create or update task record under these conditions.

If you customize or deactivate the default inbound actions, the system checks the conditions of the active inbound actions. If the system cannot find an inbound action with matching conditions, it sets the state to **Processed**.

2.  A subject line starting with a recognized reply prefix \(when neither a watermark nor an In-Reply-To header is present\) and a valid record number that matches an existing record.
3.  An In-Reply-To email header \(when no watermark is present\) that matches an existing record.

</table>If more than one inbound action is available for a particular type, the instance uses the Table field to match the email to a particular table. If there is also more than one action for the inbound action's table, the instance uses the **Order** field to determine the order in which the actions run.
