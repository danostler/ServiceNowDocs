# Application Insights

The ServiceNow® Application Insights application available in the ServiceNow Store, provides a centralized location where you can visualize and monitor system health.

Starting with the Zurich release, Application Insights is no longer deployed, enhanced, or supported. It is recommended to evaluate the [Overview of Instance Observer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/impact/io-overview.md) product available with the ServiceNow Impact packages. Work with your Account team to review Impact packages.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

## Request apps on the Store

Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) website to view all the available apps and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

## Overview

Application Insights enables you to proactively manage the health and performance of your instances. Application Insights provides time-series graphs and data that enable you to visualize performance trends, see correlated events, and access resources to take corrective action.

You can access Application Insights by logging in as a user with the admin or sn\_app\_insights.admin role and navigating to **All** &gt; **Application Insights** &gt; **Application Insights**.

## Key benefits

-   View the health and performance of all your instance nodes in one place.
-   Detect anomalies or deviations in instance performance.
-   Take corrective actions and resolve performance issues on your own without having to involve an administrator.
-   Analyze the root cause of a performance issue by determining the context and correlation with system events such as an upgrade or application install.
-   Proactively mitigate potential risks to the system. Identify and pre-empt risks that would otherwise lead to issues.
