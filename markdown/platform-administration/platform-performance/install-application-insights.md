# Install Application Insights

You can install the Application Insights application \(sn\_app\_insights\) if you have the admin role.

## Before you begin

Starting with the Zurich release, Application Insights is no longer deployed, enhanced, or supported. It is recommended to evaluate the [Overview of Instance Observer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/impact/io-overview.md) product available with the ServiceNow Impact packages. Work with your Account team to review Impact packages.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

-   Confirm that the application and all of its associated ServiceNow Store applications have valid ServiceNow entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).
-   Application Insights requires the following plugin.

    -   **Required ServiceNow plugins**
        -   **MetricBase \(com.snc.clotho\)**

            You must request the MetricBase \(com.snc.clotho\) plugin from Now Support before you install Application Insights.

    **Important:** The MetricBase plugin must be activated by ServiceNow personnel via a Catalog Item request, in order to properly install and configure the ClothoDB. If you attempt to activate MetricBase on the instance yourself, the ClothoDB is not provisioned and Application Insights displays a 500: Internal Server Error.

    If you need this plugin activated in more than one instance, you must submit separate requests for each instance.


Role required: admin
