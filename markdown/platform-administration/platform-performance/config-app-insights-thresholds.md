# Configure Application Insights thresholds

Configure conditional thresholds to trigger an alert that notifies you when one or more metrics, such as response time, is outside of the desired range.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_app\_insights.admin or admin

Starting with the Zurich release, Application Insights is no longer deployed, enhanced, or supported. It is recommended to evaluate the [Overview of Instance Observer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/impact/io-overview.md) product available with the ServiceNow Impact packages. Work with your Account team to review Impact packages.

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Application Insights** &gt; **Application Insights**.

2.  Select **Thresholds**.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  Enter a name.

For more information about configuring triggers, see [Configure Application Insights threshold triggers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/platform-performance/conf-app-insights-thresh-triggers.md).

    1.  Select the existing threshold from the Thresholds list.

    2.  Edit the name and other values.
