# Mark as Solution button

The **Mark as Solution** button is added to the KB popup view and displayed when you search the knowledge base from a task record.

Selecting **Mark as Solution** creates a record in the Task / KB Relationships `[task_rel_kb]` table to associate the KB article with a task. You can disable this button by marking the active field false on the 'solution\_button' UI macro.
