# Show borders between search result cards in global search

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin or admin

## About this task

By default, AI Search displays no borders between search result cards on the global search results page. You can enable display of borders between search result cards on the global search results page by configuring the search result wrapper component for the Unified Navigation app in UI Builder.

    UI Builder opens in a new browser tab.

2.  In the list of available experiences, open the **Unified Navigation App** record.

3.  In the Pages and variants listing, open the **Search Results** &gt; **search Default** record.

    UI Builder reloads and displays settings for the Search Results \(search Default\) page.

4.  In the Content pane, select the **Body \(Grid\)** &gt; **Search Result Wrapper 1** component.

    Properties, styles, and events for the selected component appear in the configuration panel.

5.  If a `Different application scope` informational message appears, select **Edit in original scope**.

    The system displays an informational message indicating that you are editing in the application scope.
