# Connect your custom embedding model with the Generative AI application

Integrate your custom embedding model with a capability definition to help the Generative AI application understand your data better and deliver more relevant, tailored responses.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All**, and then enter `sys_generative_ai_config.list` in the filter to go to the Generative AI Configurations \[sys\_generative\_ai\_config\] table.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Verify that **Definition Table** field is prepopulated with sys\_one\_extend\_capability\_definition.

4.  In the **Definition** field, select the search icon \(\[Omitted image "Banner\_GlobalTextSearchIcon.png"\] Alt text: Lookup documents using list.\)to select the definition document.

    1.  In the **Table name** field, select One API System Executor \[one\_api\_system\_executor\].

    2.  In the **Document** field, select the OneExtend capability definition that you want to integrate with the embedding model.

    3.  Select **OK**.

5.  In the **Model** field, select an embedding model of your choice.

6.  Select the **Active** option.

7.  Populate the **Additional Configurations** field.

    -   In the **Name** field, enter `resource _path`.
    -   In the **Value** field, enter the end point path for the connection alias URL that you created for your embedding model.

        For example, `/text-embedding-3-large/embeddings?api-version=2023-05-15`.

        It ensures that the base URL remains generic and reusable, while the specific resource path can be adjusted as needed for different models. For more information, see [Configuring resource path for your custom embedding model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-search/configuring-resource-path-for-byom.md).

8.  Select **Submit**.
