# Create an indexed source from the AI Search Admin console

Define an indexed source to make content and metadata from ServiceNow AI Platform table records searchable by using AI Search.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or ais\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Search Admin** &gt; **AI Search Admin Home**.

2.  On the **Shared Configurations** tab, select the **Indexed Sources** tab.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Indexed Source form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-search/indexed-source-form-ais.md).

    **Note:**

    -   You may see more field values on the form that aren't visible on your user interface. Make sure that you fill in all the required fields and ignore the extra fields.
    -   You can't create more than one indexed source for a single ServiceNow AI Platform table.
5.  Select **Save**.


## What to do next

To control how your new indexed source processes source records and fields during indexing, configure its indexed source attributes and field settings. For more information, see [Set up a field configuration for an indexed source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-search/ais-admin-console-setup-field-config-indexed-source.md).

To make content from internal indexed sources and source records searchable, perform a full table index for your new indexed source. For more information, see [Index the content from an indexed source for searchability](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-search/ais-admin-console-start-content-indexing.md).
