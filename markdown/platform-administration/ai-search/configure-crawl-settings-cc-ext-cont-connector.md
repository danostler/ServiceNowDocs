# Configure crawl settings for an Atlassian Confluence Cloud external content connector

Specify the spaces you want your Atlassian Confluence Cloud external content connector to crawl. Define inclusion or exclusion filters for file extensions to dictate the types of documents the crawl retrieves and feeds to AI Search for indexing.

## Before you begin

A connector administrator must have already created the Atlassian Confluence Cloud external content connector that you want to configure crawl settings for. To learn about this procedure, see [Create an Atlassian Confluence Cloud external content connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-search/create-ext-cont-connector-acc.md).

Role required: sn\_ext\_conn.xcc\_admin

## About this task

This task is optional. By default, the Atlassian Confluence Cloud external content connector crawls all spaces from its specified source system and sends documents with all supported file extensions to AI Search for indexing. Only perform this task if you want the connector to use any of the following non-default settings:

-   Inclusion or exclusion filters for the spaces to crawl when running content crawls
-   Inclusion or exclusion filters for the attachment file extensions to retrieve when running content crawls

**Important:**

By default, each external content connector can index up to one million \(1,000,000\) content items from its source system. When a connector exceeds this limit, it continues to crawl the source system, but only sends content item deletions and updates to AI Search for indexing, ignoring new content items. The connector logs an error message for every 10,000 content items it crawls beyond the indexing limit.

When a connector's indexed content item count exceeds 800,000, a warning message appears in the connector's UI to indicate that it's approaching the indexing limit. If the connector reaches the indexing limit, an error message appears in its UI.

External content connectors that support user permissions crawls can handle permissions for up to five hundred thousand \(500,000\) users and their groups. If a connector retrieves users in excess of this limit, user and group permissions may not be correctly applied to the connector's retrieved content. As a result, the content may not be searchable.

If one of your connectors reaches the content indexing limit, you can update its crawl settings and file inclusion/exclusion filters to reduce the number of content items it retrieves. Alternatively, if you need a connector to index more than 1,000,000 content items, you can create a Customer Service and Support case at [https://support.servicenow.com/now](https://support.servicenow.com/now) to request a limit increase for the connector.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **External Content Connectors** &gt; **External Content Admin Home**.

2.  In the Connectors list, select the record for the Atlassian Confluence Cloud external content connector whose settings you want to modify.

3.  In the connector editor's Settings tab, select **Crawl settings**.

4.  Select one of the following **Spaces** options:

    -   To crawl all spaces from the source system, select **Crawl all spaces**.
    -   To crawl only a specified set of spaces from the source system, select **Include only these spaces**, then use the **Add URL** field and **Add** button to enter URLs for spaces that you want to include in the crawl.

        For example, you might enter `https://example.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Z6BU8S2J2LQRS` to include only searchable content from the specified space.

    -   To crawl all except a specified set of spaces from the source system, select **Exclude only these spaces**, then use the **Add URL** field and **Add** button to enter URLs for spaces that you want to exclude from the crawl.

        For example, you might enter `https://example.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/V3TXFZNUFD5YI` to exclude searchable content from the specified space.

5.  Select one of the following **Attachment filtering** options:

    -   To retrieve all attachments with supported file extensions from the source system, select **Crawl all attachments**.
    -   To retrieve only attachments with specified file extensions from the source system, select **Include only these file extensions**, then use the **File extensions to include** field to enter attachment file extensions you want the connector to include when crawling.

        As an example, you might enter `.docx` to retrieve only attachments with the Microsoft Word file format.

    -   To retrieve all attachments except those with specified file extensions from the source system, select **Exclude only these file extensions**, then use the **File extensions to exclude** field to enter attachment file extensions you want the connector to exclude when crawling.

        As an example, you might enter `.csv` to exclude attachments with the Comma-Separated Values \(CSV\) file format.

    For details on the supported attachment file extensions, see [Binary file extensions supported in External Content Connectors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-search/file-extensions-ext-cont-connector.md).

6.  Select **Save**.


## Result

The Atlassian Confluence Cloud external content connector is updated with your crawl scope and file extension filter settings.

## What to do next

Now that you've configured the crawl for your Atlassian Confluence Cloud source system using your modified crawl settings, create and run a one-time content crawl for your Atlassian Confluence Cloud external content connector. To learn about creating and running one-time content crawls, see [Create a content crawl for an external content connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-search/create-content-crawl-external-content-connector.md).
