# Set up a connection and credential alias for a third-party embedding model

Set up a connection and credential alias to authenticate an integration between your ServiceNow instance and a third-party embedding model.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The system provides the default connection and credential alias for the Azure OpenAI Embedding model \(text-embedding-3-large\), Google Gemini Embedding model \(gemini-embedding-001\), and Amazon Sagemaker Voyage. You set up these default aliases to manage the secure connection of your ServiceNow instance with either embedding model. A connection and credential alias includes the endpoint URL of the models and the login details, such as the OAuth token or API key. A connection and credential alias tells the system how to connect to these third-party models.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Connections &amp; Credentials** &gt; **Connection &amp; Credential Aliases**.

2.  Select an alias that you want to set up.

    -   To set up the embedding model alias for Azure OpenAI Embedding, select **Azure OpenAI**.
    -   To set up the embedding model alias for Google Gemini Embedding, select **Google Gemini API**.
    -   To set up the embedding model alias for AWS voyage Embedding, select **Amazon Sagemaker Voyage**.
3.  Create a connection record for your alias.

    1.  In the Connections related list, select **New**.

    2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

        For a description of the field values, see .

    3.  Select **Submit**.

    The connection record is created.

4.  Create a credential record for your alias.

    1.  In the Connections related list, select a connection record from the connection alias list.

        -   Select the connection record that you created in step 3 for the Azure OpenAI alias.
        -   Select the connection record that you created in step 3 for the Google Gemini API alias.
        -   Select the connection record that you created in step 3 for the AWS voyage alias.
    2.  In the Credentials field, select the search icon \(\[Omitted image "Banner\_GlobalTextSearchIcon.png"\] Alt text: Lookup using list.\) and then select **New**.

    3.  From the list of credentials, select a credential type.

        -   To create a credential record for the Azure OpenAI alias, select **API Key Credentials**.
        -   To create a credential record for the Google Gemini API alias, select **OAuth 2.0 Credentials**.
        -   To create a credential record for the Amazon Sagemaker Voyage alias, select **AWS Credentials**.
    4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

        For a description of the field values, see  for the Azure OpenAI alias,  for the Google Gemini API alias, or [AWS credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-search/aws-credentials-form.md) for the Amazon Sagemaker Voyage alias.

    5.  Select **Submit**.

    6.  Select **Update**.

    The credential record is created.


## What to do next

Activate the embedding model to start using it. For more information, see [Activate a third-party embedding model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-search/activate-3p-embedding-model.md).
