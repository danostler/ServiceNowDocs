# Generative AI model configuration form

The Generative AI model configuration form contains information about a custom embedding model that your AI Search Retrieval Augmented Generation \(RAG\) application uses to generate embeddings for semantic indexing. Use this form when creating or modifying a custom embedding model.

For details on creating or modifying a custom embedding model, see [Create a custom embedding model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-search/create-byom.md).
