# Activate a third-party embedding model

Activate your preferred embedding model, whether third-party or custom, so that the AI Search Retrieval Augmented Generation \(RAG\) application knows which model to use for generating embeddings.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** and then enter `ais_semantic_embedding_model.list` in the filter.

2.  Select an embedding model from the list of AI Search Semantic Embedding Models.

3.  On the Semantic Embedding Model page, turn on the embedding model by selecting **Active**.

4.  Select **Update**.

5.  Run a quick check to verify that everything is set up correctly by selecting **Validate**.

    **Note:** If you make any changes to its configuration, you must validate the embedding model.


## Result

Your preferred embedding model, whether third-party or custom, is ready to use in the AI Search Retrieval Augmented Generation \(RAG\) application.

## What to do next

Add your embedding model to the semantic index configuration to enable content ingestion by using that model. For more information, see [Configure semantic indexing settings for an indexed source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-search/configure-semantic-indexing-ais.md).
