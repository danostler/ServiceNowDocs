# Configure crawl settings for an Atlassian Jira Cloud external content connector

Specify the projects you want your Atlassian Jira Cloud external content connector to crawl. Define inclusion or exclusion filters to dictate the types of content the crawl retrieves and feeds to AI Search for indexing.

## Before you begin

A connector administrator must have already created the Atlassian Jira Cloud external content connector that you want to configure crawl settings for. To learn about this procedure, see [Create an Atlassian Jira Cloud external content connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-search/create-ext-cont-connector-jira.md).

Role required: sn\_ext\_conn.xcc\_admin

## About this task

This task is optional. By default, the Atlassian Jira Cloud external content connector crawls all projects from its specified source system and sends documents with all supported file extensions to AI Search for indexing. Only perform this task if you want the connector to use any of the following non-default settings:

-   Inclusion or exclusion filters for the projects to crawl when running content crawls
-   Inclusion or exclusion filters for the attachment file extensions to retrieve when running content crawls

**Important:**

By default, each external content connector can index up to one million \(1,000,000\) content items from its source system. When a connector exceeds this limit, it continues to crawl the source system, but only sends content item deletions and updates to AI Search for indexing, ignoring new content items. The connector logs an error message for every 10,000 content items it crawls beyond the indexing limit.

When a connector's indexed content item count exceeds 800,000, a warning message appears in the connector's UI to indicate that it's approaching the indexing limit. If the connector reaches the indexing limit, an error message appears in its UI.

External content connectors that support user permissions crawls can handle permissions for up to five hundred thousand \(500,000\) users and their groups. If a connector retrieves users in excess of this limit, user and group permissions may not be correctly applied to the connector's retrieved content. As a result, the content may not be searchable.

If one of your connectors reaches the content indexing limit, you can update its crawl settings and file inclusion/exclusion filters to reduce the number of content items it retrieves. Alternatively, if you need a connector to index more than 1,000,000 content items, you can create a Customer Service and Support case at [https://support.servicenow.com/now](https://support.servicenow.com/now) to request a limit increase for the connector.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **External Content Connectors** &gt; **External Content Admin Home**.

2.  In the Connectors list, select the record for the Atlassian Jira Cloud external content connector whose settings you want to modify.

3.  In the connector editor's Settings tab, select **Crawl settings**.

4.  Select one of the following **Content filtering** options:

    -   To crawl all projects from the source system, select **All**, then optionally select **Exclude projects** and use the **Add URL** field and **Add** button to enter URLs for any projects that you want to exclude from the crawl.
    -   To crawl only a specified set of projects from the source system, select **Specify**, then use the **Add URL** field and **Add** button to enter URLs for the projects that you want to include in the crawl.
5.  To apply inclusion or exclusion filters to a crawl based on file extensions, perform the following steps:

    1.  Select **Filter by file extension**.

    2.  To specify the type of filter, select **Include** or **Exclude**.

        Select **Include** if you want the crawl to only retrieve documents that have one of the specified file extensions. Select **Exclude** if you want the crawl to retrieve all documents except those that have one of the specified file extensions.

    3.  In the **File extension** field, select the file extensions that you want to include or exclude.

        For details on the supported file extensions, see [Binary file extensions supported in External Content Connectors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-search/file-extensions-ext-cont-connector.md).

6.  Select **Save**.


## Result

The Atlassian Jira Cloud external content connector is updated with your crawl scope and file extension filter settings.

## What to do next

To retrieve content from your Atlassian Jira Cloud source system using your modified crawl settings, create and run a one-time content crawl for your Atlassian Jira Cloud external content connector. To learn about creating and running one-time content crawls, see [Create a content crawl for an external content connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-administration/ai-search/create-content-crawl-external-content-connector.md).
