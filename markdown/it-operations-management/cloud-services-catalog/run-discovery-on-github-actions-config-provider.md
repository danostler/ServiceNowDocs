# Run Discovery on GitHub Actions config provider

Discover all repositories and workflows in your organization by adding a GitHub Actions config provider and running Discovery on it using the Cloud Services Catalog application.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmp.cloud\_admin

## Procedure

1.  In the Cloud Admin Portal, navigate to **Manage** &gt; **Credentials**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Select **API Key Credentials**.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_dvm_wp3_khc"><thead><tr><th>

</td></tr><tr><td>

MID servers

This field appears only when **Some MID servers** is selected from the **Applies to** field. It provides fields through which you can select the target MID Servers.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Order

</td><td>

Order in which  Discovery  tries this credential when it attempts to log on to devices. The smaller the number, the higher in the list this credential appears. Providing a credential order is helpful when using large numbers of credentials or when security locks out users after three failed login attempts.

 If all the credentials have the same order number \(or none\), the instance tries the credentials in a random order.

5.  Select **Submit**.

6.  Add a config provider.

7.  Navigate to **Manage** &gt; **Config Management**.

8.  Initiate discovery of config installables and create an order in the sn\_cmp\_order table to start the discovery process by selecting **Discover Now**.

    The name of the config installable displays when creating a new template version.


## Result

Discovered config installables are saved in the sn\_cmp\_cfg\_installable table using the format ProviderName.WorkflowName.
