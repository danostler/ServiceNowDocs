# Quick start tests for Metric Intelligence

Validate that Metric Intelligence still works after you make any configuration change such as apply an upgrade or develop an application. Copy and configure these quick start tests to pass when using your instance-specific data.

Metric Intelligence quick start tests require activating the Metric Intelligence plugin \(com.snc.sa.metric\).

An individual test that verifies the following:

-   There is at least one Metric Intelligence Metrics extension that is running.
-   There are entries for the ‘Health Metrics’ in the Metric to CI table.
-   For each of the Metric Intelligence Metrics extensions that are currently running, that there is data stored in MetricBase.

 If the test initially fails, wait until the Metric Intelligence Metrics extension runs for at least 10-15 minutes. Then try again.
