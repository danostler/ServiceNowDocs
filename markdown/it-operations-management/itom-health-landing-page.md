# ITOM AIOps

The ServiceNow® ITOM AIOps product includes the ServiceNow® Event Management and ServiceNow® Metric Intelligence applications, which help you track and maintain the health of services in your organization.

## Features of ITOM AIOps

-   **Event Management**

    Event Management gathers alerts from infrastructure events captured by third-party monitoring tools. Event Management uses IT-related information gathered by Discovery to map alerts to configuration items. Based on the collected information, Event Management then provides dashboards showing a consolidated view of all service-impact events.

-   **Agent Client Collector**

    Use the ServiceNow® Agent Client Collector application to monitor your service availability, examine the health and performance of your environment, and ensure that your infrastructure and its applications are running properly. You can also proactively analyze your IT infrastructure to spot issues and prevent service outages, using Metric Intelligence. Using advanced machine learning to analyze information about your IT infrastructure, the Metric Intelligence application automatically determines dynamic thresholds and identifies anomalies that may indicate potential service outages.

-   **Health Log Analytics**

    The ServiceNow® Health Log Analytics application predicts IT issues before they impact users. The application helps you solve problems faster by ingesting, understanding, and correlating machine-generated log data in real time. It notices any deviation from normal behavior when it happens and alerts you of possible business-impacting issues. Health Log Analytics receives and processes logs via the MID Server and sends events to the ServiceNow® Event Management application.

-   **Service Observability**

    The ServiceNow® Service Observability application helps operations teams triage and manage incidents in a complex and distributed production system. It combines external application performance monitoring \(APM\) systems' telemetry with related data from the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) and displays both in a single workflow in the Service Operations Workspace.

-   **Synthetic monitoring**

    he ServiceNow® Synthetic monitoring application empowers organizations to proactively manage and enhance the performance and availability of critical services. By simulating user transactions on API endpoints, this solution identifies performance bottlenecks, helps ensure up-time, and optimizes user experiences.

-   **Service Operations Workspace for ITOM**

    Service Operations Workspace for ITOM is a configurable workspace that provides a unified experience for multiple IT Operations Management workflows. Service Operations Workspace for ITOM enables you to manage the life cycle of alerts, including running actions to resolve alerts and identifying the underlying issue of an alert.
