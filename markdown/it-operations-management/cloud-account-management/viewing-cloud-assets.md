# Viewing cloud assets

This page displays the Cloud assets view. It lists all compute assets across connected cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI along with location, cloud account, installation status, owner, discovered dates, ownership attestation, and cost center.

As an admin, you can access the dashboard by navigating to **All** &gt; **Cloud Workspace** &gt; **Monitor and track**

Click the respective name to view the details.

**Note:** Duplicate LDC entries no longer appear in the Region filter in Cloud Asset Explorer. After upgrading your instance to the latest version, the Region filter may be empty until the background job completes its initial run. Depending on data volume, this can take several hours. The job runs approximately every 30 minutes automatically.

In Asset Explorer, retired configuration items \(CIs\) remain in the asset table as long as they exist in the CMDB, even after retirement. To manage this, users can configure a custom retention period \(in seconds\) that automatically removes retired CIs from the asset table after the defined duration. For example, setting the property to 86,400 seconds \(1 day\) ensures that a retired CI is removed from the asset table one day after retirement, even though it may continue to exist in the CMDB. This helps improve performance for high-volume environments by ensuring that only active CIs remain in the asset table.
