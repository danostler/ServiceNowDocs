# Configure SNMP Trap collection for high availability

For SNMP traps, the MID Server requires failover configuration for the trap listener.

You can configure two MID Servers for failover. Because the SNMP Trap listener on the MID Server receives inbound traffic on the IP address and port of the MID Server, you configure each MID Server to receive the same SNMP traps. Only one MID Server is active at any point in time, therefore Event Management does not receive duplicate traps.
