# RMA AI agentic workflow

Automate and streamline Return Material Authorization \(RMA\) case handling, reducing manual intervention, improving responsiveness, and ensuring consistent decision-making.

## RMA AI Agent Overview

Install the Customer Service RMA AI Agents plugin \(app-csm-rma-case-ai-agent\) to use the **RMA AI** agentic workflow.

-   **Case creation**: Initiate RMA cases through the business portal or virtual agent by providing product details and return reasons. The agent fetches install base items and validates them automatically.
-   **Case processing**: The support assistant performs entitlement and warranty checks, proposes resolutions, and communicates with the customer for approval and next steps.
-   **Proactive updates**: The agent provides updates on case status, entitlements information, case summary, ensuring customers are informed throughout the process.
-   **Customer interaction**: Customers can interact via chat, select install base items, and specify reasons for return, replacement, or repair. The AI agent guides users through the process and offers recommendations if entitlements are not available.
-   **Live agent handoff**: If required, the agent can transfer the case to a live agent for further assistance.
-   **Role-based actions**: Both the requester persona and the Fullfiller persona will have access to create and process the RMA Case using the RMA AI Assistant.

To modify the **RMA AI** agentic workflow [duplicate it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/intelligent-experiences/enable-ai-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md), and adjust the settings according to your requirements. You can activate the agentic workflow template by making triggers active and setting the display settings to include the Now Assist panel.

**Important:** When you modify an agentic workflow, AI agent, or tool, make sure that you update all instructions accordingly.
