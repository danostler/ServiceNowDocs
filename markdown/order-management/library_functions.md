# Library functions

Library functions can speed implementation and reduce maintenance costs by enabling code reuse across rules.

Library functions enable efficient code reuse across rules and enrichments. They are designed to minimize redundant logic, speed up implementation, and reduce maintenance costs, especially in complex scenarios involving high-SKU or physics-driven configurations.

## Attributes and capabilities

Reusable and namespaced: defined once and invoked using `fn.functionName(params)`.

Parameter management: define input parameters with data types and default values.

Output handling: specify return types.

Centralized management: searchable and manageable through a dedicated UI. Callable across modules: available in both the configurator and Transaction Manager.

Managed table queries: supports managed table lookups in functions.

## Enabling library functions

Submit a support ticket to enable library functions. Once the support ticket is completed, enable the new UI by navigating to Utilities &gt; Settings &gt; Admin Version &gt; New, and clicking **Save**.

This setting can be toggled at any time.

## Supported input/output data types

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|TEXT|Plain text strings|
|NUMBER|Numeric values|
|BOOLEAN|Logical true/false values|
|DATE|Dates \(without time component\)|
|JSON OBJECT|JSON formatted objects|
|ARRAY|Ordered collections of values|

**Note:** Empty MAP or ARRAY types are not supported. Unsupported types default to TEXT.

## Usage examples

Library functions can be found in the function library \(in the Utilities section\).

To add a function:

1.  On the Function Library tab, click **Add Function**.
2.  Name the function, specify the return type, and enter a description.

## Limitations and technical considerations

-   Functions must be free of side effects, external calls, and Logik field references.
-   Recursive calls are not supported.
-   External API calls and async operations are not supported.
-   Enrichments are not supported.
-   Parameters are passed by copy, not by reference.
-   Parameter schemas can be modified post-creation, allowing flexibility in managing function inputs.
-   When a library function changes, redeploy the affected blueprints.
-   Provide function visibility into function usage before edits.
