# Create an entity configuration

Create an entity configuration to compose a workflow between two entities so that you can update their existing configurations and perform actions like suspend, resume, or disconnect a sold product.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Lead to Cash** &gt; **Entity Configurations**.

2.  On the Lead to Cash Entities form, create an entity by selecting **New**.

3.  On the form, in the **Name** field, enter the entity name and in the **Config ID** field, enter the entity ID.

    For a description of the field values, see [Entity configuration and mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/order-management/sales-and-order-management/entity-configuration-and-mapping.md).

4.  Select **Submit**.

    You’ve created an entity configuration. You must now create lead-to-cash entity definitions and attributes.

5.  On the Lead to Cash Entity form, in the Lead To Cash Entity Definitions related list, create an entity definition by selecting **New**.

6.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Entity configuration and mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/order-management/sales-and-order-management/entity-configuration-and-mapping.md).

7.  Select **Submit**.

8.  On the Lead to Cash Entity form, in the Lead To Cash Entity Attributes related list, create an entity attribute by selecting **New**.
