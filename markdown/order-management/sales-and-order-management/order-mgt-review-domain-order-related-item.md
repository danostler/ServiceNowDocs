# Review the domain order related items associated with a domain order

Review the domain order related line items that were generated for a customer order line item so that you can confirm all the related details are correct and complete.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.order\_fulfillment\_manager

## About this task

Each product order contains the domain order related items that are created when a customer order is approved and then decomposed. You should review each domain order related item to make sure that they’re correct and complete. You can update them as needed.

Review if compatibility rules or horizontal relationships are configured for domain order specs.

## Procedure

1.  To view the domain order related items that are associated with a customer line item and product order, select the customer order line item and product order.

2.  Select an associated domain order related item to review or add a new domain order related item.

    For change, the new column **Existing related inventory** displays **True** for the domain order related items that are created using existing valid product inventory relationships and **False** for the domain order related items that are newly created.
