Modify a service contract line so that you can update its existing configurations.

    **Note:** The Configurator UI is displayed only if you select a single service contract line. If you selected multiple service contract lines, the order or quote created is displayed.

    An order or a quote will be created depending on the rules set in the Customer Life Cycle Workflows Policy decision table.

    -   If the selected target entity is a quote, a quote to modify the service contract line is created. You can click the quote number from the confirmation message to view the modified quote line items. The quote is approved and the status changes to **Complete** to create an order.
