# Add tabs and rows to a dashboard

A dashboard mock-up in KPI Composer requires you to lay out the tabs and rows before adding visual components.

Prerequisites
:   [Add a dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/add-dashboard-kpi-comp.md)

## Before you begin

You have an existing KPI Composer project with a complete draft of the KPI tree in the Analytics tab. You also have at least one dashboard defined in the Dashboard Visualization tab.

Role required: sn\_kpi\_composer.user \(own project\), sn\_kpi\_composer.admin \(any project\), admin. No role required for responsible user or user with edit access from project sharing.

## Procedure

1.  Open a **KPI Composer** project and navigate to the Dashboard Visualization tab.

2.  Select one of the dashboards in the tab.

3.  Click the + icon underneath the dashboards.

    \[Omitted image "kpi-comp-add-tab.png"\] Alt text: The Add Tab icon next to the other tab icons on a KPI Composer dashboard visualization.

4.  Either:

    -   Select a tab template. The tab is created with a name, rows, and canvases inherited from the template. You do not have to add rows or canvases, but you can edit the ones you have.
    -   Select **No template**. You create an empty tab and populate it with rows and canvases, as described in the rest of this procedure.
    \[Omitted image "kpi-comp-select-dashboard-template.png"\] Alt text: The Select Dashboard Template dialog that opens when you add a dashboard tab.

5.  Give the tab a meaningful name, probably matching a lower-level Critical Success Factor.

6.  Click **Add Row**.

    A row is a horizontal design area. Add at least one row to each tab.

7.  In the Row details dialog, select the number of canvases in the row.

    The term 'canvases' here refers to spaces that hold widgets and refer to artifacts. Decide how many canvases you want placed horizontally in the row. You can select up to three canvases. You can change this number or move the row later.


## Adding a tab and a row to a dashboard

In the following short animation, you see a user adding the Quality of service tab to the Customer Experience dashboard mock-up. The user gives the first row in this tab three canvases.\[Omitted image "kpi-comp-add-tab-row.gif"\] Alt text: A tab and a row being added to a dashboard.

## What to do next

Add more rows or tabs following this procedure. Or, you can add canvases to the rows you have created and come back and add more tabs and rows later.
