# Responsive dashboard properties

Use properties to fine-tune dashboard behavior and appearance.

Navigate to **System Properties** &gt; **Dashboard Properties** to configure the main responsive dashboard properties.

## Responsive Dashboard properties

<table id="table_x3q_xgb_fbb"><thead><tr><th>

Property

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Enable the unified analytics workspace experience, which shows all responsive dashboards and Next Experience dashboards in the same overview in the Analytics Center.

com.glide.par.unified\_analytics.enabled

</td><td>

-   Type: true \| false
-   Default value: false
-   Location: **System Properties** &gt; **Dashboard Properties**

 When enabled, users see both Platform Analytics and core UI \(responsive\) dashboards in the Analytics Center. Users can still drill down to KPI details from responsive dashboard indicator visualizations.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Apply security rules to the list of users, user groups, and roles that are visible when sharing dashboards.

glide.cms.dashboards.sharing\_with\_secure\_search

</td><td>

-   Type: true \| false
-   Default value: false
-   Location: **System Properties** &gt; **Dashboard Properties**

 When enabled, the list of users, user groups, and roles that are visible in the sharing panel is restricted. The restriction is based on the configuration of the sys\_user, sys\_user\_group, and sys\_user\_role ACLs. For more information, see Access control list rules.

 There is a performance penalty associated with enabling this property. Performance degradation may be based on the number and complexity of business rules and ACLs on your instance.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Specify a comma-separated list of roles that can share their own dashboards.

glide.cms.share\_dashboards.role

</td><td>

-   Type: string
-   Default value: Empty

When this property is empty, all users can share their own dashboards.

-   Location: **System Properties** &gt; **Dashboard Properties**

 **Note:** Properties that restrict dashboard sharing do not apply to users with the admin and dashboard\_admin roles. Users with these two roles can always share any dashboard.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Maximum number of seconds for a widget to render on a responsive dashboard.

glide.canvas.grid.widget\_performance\_threshold

</td><td>

-   Type: integer
-   Default value: none
-   Location: **System Properties** &gt; **Dashboard Properties**

 For more information, see [Optimize widget rendering time on responsive dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/t_optimizeWidgetRenderingTime.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Maximum number of widgets that can render simultaneously on a responsive dashboard.

glide.canvas.grid.widget\_render\_concurrent\_max

</td><td>

-   Type: integer
-   Default value: 3
-   Location: **System Properties** &gt; **Dashboard Properties**

 For more information, see [Optimize widget rendering time on responsive dashboards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/t_optimizeWidgetRenderingTime.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Number of seconds that responsive dashboard widgets are cached in the browser.

glide.canvas.grid.widget\_cache\_ttl

</td><td>

-   Type: integer
-   Default value: 2
-   Location: **System Properties** &gt; **Dashboard Properties**

</td></tr><tr><td>

Number of users, groups, and roles returned when searching for a name in the Share panel of a Responsive Dashboard.The value of this property is per category, so the default value of 100 may yield 300 results - 100 users, 100 groups, and 100 roles.

glide.cms.dashboards.sharing.search.maxRecords

</td><td>

-   Type: integer
-   Default value: 100
-   Location: sys\_properties.list

 Setting the value too low can cause the expected results not to be found. The minimum value is 5. Setting the value too high can cause performance issues.
