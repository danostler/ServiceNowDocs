# Add canvases to a dashboard tab

Combine analytics artifacts and widgets to create visual components, called canvases, on a KPI Composer dashboard mock-up. "Widgets" include reports, interactive filters, Spotlight, and content blocks.

Prerequisites
:   [Add a dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/add-dashboard-kpi-comp.md)

:   [Add tabs and rows to a dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/now-intelligence/performance-analytics/add-tabs-kpi-dashboard.md)

## Before you begin

You have an existing KPI Composer project with a complete draft of the KPI tree in the Analytics tab. You also have at least one dashboard defined in the Dashboard Visualization tab. Lastly, one of these dashboards has at least one tab, containing at least one row.

Role required: sn\_kpi\_composer.user \(own project\), sn\_kpi\_composer.admin \(any project\), admin. No role required for responsible user or user with edit access from project sharing.

## Procedure

1.  Open a **KPI Composer** project and navigate to the Dashboard Visualization tab.

2.  Select one of the dashboards in the tab.

    Select a dashboard with at least one tab and a row with empty canvas slots.

3.  In the upper right of the Dashboard Visualization tab, expand the Artifacts icon \(\[Omitted image "kpi-comp-elements-icon.png"\] Alt text:\).

4.  Select an artifact that you want to represent in a canvas slot, and drag the artifact to the slot.

    You previously defined these artifacts in the KPI tree in the Analysis tab.

    You can drop multiple artifacts into the same canvas slot. You can even drop artifacts onto a canvas slot after you have added a widget to that slot. However, you cannot drop artifacts onto a canvas slot that contains a content block or an interactive filter widget.

    When you drag an artifact onto an unnamed canvas, you give the name of the artifact to the canvas. Dragging additional artifacts onto the canvas does not change the name.

    If you have selected any personas in the dashboard properties, only the artifacts that are linked to those personas are available.

5.  In the upper right of the Dashboard Visualization tab, expand the Widgets icon \(\[Omitted image "kpi-comp-widgets-icon.png"\] Alt text:\).

6.  Decide which widget represents the data in the artifact you previously selected, and drag it to the same canvas slot.

    Widget designs use static images and not actual data visualizations.

    Interactive Filter widgets only affect Report widgets that are on the same dashboard.

    Spotlight "widgets" represent Spotlight interactive analysis, which is usually accessed through a shared URL instead of a report on a dashboard. For more inforrmation, see [Spotlight interactive analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/now-intelligence/spotlight/spotlight-interactive-analysis.md).

    To replace a widget on a canvas, drag another widget onto it. The title of the original widget remains, unless you replace it with a Content Block. Replacing widgets does not affect artifacts associated with a canvas.

    After you drag a widget, the Canvas Details dialog opens.

7.  Fill in the Canvas Details, as follows:

    **Note:** To change the Canvas Details of an existing widget, click the pencil icon \(\[Omitted image "kpi-composer-edit-item.png"\] Alt text:\) on the canvas. This icon appears when you point to the top-right corner of a canvas.

## Result

You have an artifact from your analysis and a visualization to illustrate that artifact on your dashboard.

## Adding a canvas to a dashboard

**Note:** In this short animation, a canvas is added to the Quality of Service tab of the Customer Experience dashboard. The user first picks an artifact from their KPI Tree and then selects a widget to illustrate that artifact. \[Omitted image "kpi-comp-add-canvas.gif"\] Alt text: Adding a canvas to a dashboard

## What to do next

When you have populated a dashboard, you can change the row order, widget order, or widget title in the artifact banner. The following short animation demonstrates how to move dashboard components.
