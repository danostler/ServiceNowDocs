# Dashboard component events

Select event handlers to configure the actions \(events\) provided with the dashboard component.

The Events tab shows the events used by the dashboard component. To view the available events, select **+ Add event mapping**. Select the event in the list to add one or more event handlers.

## Event handlers

Event handlers work with data resources to link the dashboard actions to the data you want to display to your users. Select the event in the list to add one or more event handlers.

Navigate to dashboard overview page

</td><td>

Dispatched when the dashboard is closed and redirects to the dashboard library. You can customize this behavior by changing the route and title in the Redirect to dashboard list client script. To open client scripts, select the &lt;&gt; icon in the page's side bar.```javascript
* @param {params} params
* @param {api} params.api
* @param {any} params.event
* @param {any} params.imports
* @param {ApiHelpers} params.helpers
*/
function handler({api}) {
    api.emit('SCREEN_STATUS_CHANGED', {status: 'closed'});
    api.emit('NAV_ITEM_SELECTED', {
        route: 'dashboard-library',
        title: 'Dashboard Library',
    });
}
```

</td></tr><tr><td>

Dashboard Widget Clicked

</td><td>

Add this event handler if you want to override the default drilldown with custom behavior when a visualization on the dashboard is clicked. It uses the Dashboard Widget Clicked client script. To add a custom drilldown:

1.  Set the defaultDrilldowns property to false.
2.  Add the Dashboard Widget Clicked event handler.
3.  Open the Dashboard Widget Clicked client script. To open client scripts, select the &lt;&gt; icon in the page's side bar.
4.  Locate the code `api.emit('NAV_ITEM_SELECTED', payload);` and update `payload` to align with your custom redirect logic.
