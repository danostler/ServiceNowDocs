# Configure repeating pattern finding definition

Configure a repeating pattern finding definition to view a pattern with a series of repeating sequence of steps.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_process\_optimization\_analyst, sn\_process\_optimization\_power\_user, or sn\_process\_optimization\_admin

Repeating pattern finding definition displays the repetition of a specific order of steps. This brings the focus to the areas where you want to improve or automate certain parts or the process that are revisited.

    -   A record must be repeated at least 2 times.
    -   The repeating pattern must have at least 3 steps.
    -   Only the top 5 repeated patterns are displayed in the Summary and insights page.
6.  Select **Save and exit**.
