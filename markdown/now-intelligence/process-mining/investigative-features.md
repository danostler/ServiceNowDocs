# Configure investigative features

Configure investigative features to set advanced analytics features for a process.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_process\_optimization\_power\_user or sn\_process\_optimization\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Process Mining Workspace**.

2.  On the side of the page, select the Process configurations icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-process-config.png"\] Alt text: Process configuration builder\).

3.  Open a table from the **Configurations** tab.

    The **Process details** page is displayed. Select **Investigative features** from the side panel.

    If you’re proceeding from the **Recommendations setup** page, then you come to this page. For more information, see [Configure recommendations setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/now-intelligence/process-mining/reco-setup.md).

    The **Investigative features** page has four sections:

    -   Automated root cause analysis
    -   Cluster analysis
    -   Work notes analysis
    -   Automation Discovery
    \[Omitted image "invest-features-config.png"\] Alt text: Investigative features in process configuration

4.  Add fields that you want for automated root cause analysis in the **Automated root cause analysis** field.

    Select the help icon \(?\) to view details about how and why these details must be set. You also get a list of resources.

    Based on your inputs on the **Process details** page, you get recommendations for automated root cause analysis.

    When you set up the automated root cause analysis, you can initiate a root cause analysis in your project that is based on this table. For more information on running root case analysis, see [Run automated root cause analysis reports](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/now-intelligence/process-mining/run-view-arca.md).

    **Note:** If the automated root cause analysis isn’t set up in the process configuration, it isn’t available.

5.  Select an existing clustering definition in the **Cluster analysis** field.

    Select the help icon \(?\) to view details about how and why these details must be set. You also get a list of resources.

    For more information about running a cluster analysis, see [Perform a cluster analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/now-intelligence/process-mining/request-cluster-analysis.md).

    If there are no clustering analyses, select **New clustering definition**.

    Provide a name for the clustering analysis and provide fields that you want to use for your cluster analysis, and then select **Configure**.

    **Note:** Cluster analysis isn’t available unless the clustering definition is selected in the process configuration.

    For more information, see [Configure a process for a clustering solution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/now-intelligence/process-mining/process-configuration-clustering.md).

6.  Select **New clustering definition** if no clustering analysis is available.

    The **New clustering definition** dialog is displayed.

    1.  Provide a name for the clustering analysis.

    2.  Select fields that you want to use for your cluster analysis.

        Remember that records are grouped based on similarity of text in the selected fields.

    3.  Select **Configure**.

7.  Fill the details in **Work notes analysis** section.

    Select the help icon \(?\) to view details about how and why these details must be set. You also get a list of resources.

    For information on running work notes analysis, see [Perform work notes analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/now-intelligence/process-mining/perform-worknotes-analysis.md).

    **Note:** Work notes analysis isn’t available unless it’s set up in the process configuration.

    You can use the Now Assist feature for work notes analysis even with 5-50 eligible work notes. If there are less than 25 eligible work notes, clustering isn’t performed. It puts all the work notes into one LLM call. Otherwise, clustering is performed before calling the LLM.

</table>8.  Fill the details in the **Automation Discovery** section.

    Select the help icon \(?\) to view details about how and why these details must be set. You also get a list of resources.

    **Note:** This section is available only when Automation Discovery is available.

    Automation Discovery helps to identify automation opportunities within your processes. You can use the automation discovery reports to implement or improve automation solutions like Virtual Agent \(VA\) or Agent assist. These reports are available on the **Automation Opportunities** tab in the Process Mining workspace.

    For information on configuring Automation Discovery, see [Configure Automation Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/now-intelligence/process-mining/config-finding-def-auto-disc.md).

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |**Turn on automation discovery**|Select the field if you want to use the Automation Discovery feature.|
    |**Field used to surface automation opportunities**|Select the fields for automation opportunities.|
    |**Taxonomy**|Select a taxonomy that categorizes your records using prebuilt automation opportunities rather than grouping them into clusters.|
    |**Auto-run with mining**|Select this field if you want to run the automation discovery job automatically every time you mine a project.|

9.  Select **Continue to impact metrics**.
