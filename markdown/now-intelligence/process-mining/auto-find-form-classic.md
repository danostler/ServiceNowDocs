Type

</td><td>

Type of finding. You can select from the list available. Three options are available:-   Rework: Refers to a repeating step or activity in the process. It happens when a process step must be redone or revisited.
-   Ping-Pong: Refers to a repetitive pattern where a record bounces between two process steps or activities without interruption, indicating a loop.
-   Extra step: Compares each route to identify the existence of different routes that deviate in only one step, thus pinpointing process steps where unnecessary transitions occur.
-   Repeating patterns: Detects unnecessary repeating sequence of steps.
-   Extreme duration: Finds records with a very long transition time compared to other transition records.
-   Extreme repetition: Finds records with a very high number of arc repetitions compared to other records on the same arc.
-   Slow transition: Identifies situations where there is a cluster of records with similar durations, and this cluster has a higher average duration compared to other group of records. This detector also offers a breakdown of the significance of the identified cluster, providing further insights into the root cause.
