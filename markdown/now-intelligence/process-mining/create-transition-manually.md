# Create a transition filter manually

Create a transition filter to meet your needs and apply it to view the result on the process graph.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_process\_optimization\_analyst, sn\_process\_optimization\_power\_user, or sn\_process\_optimization\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Process Mining Workspace**.

2.  Open a project for which you want to set the transition filter.

3.  Go to the **Analyst workbench** tab.

4.  Select **Transitions** from the Advanced filters area.

    \[Omitted image "transition-location-1.png"\] Alt text: Transitions from Advanced filters area

    The transition filter form is displayed.

5.  Fill the transition filter form with the required conditions.

    \[Omitted image "transition-filter.png"\] Alt text: Transition filter conditions

    The predicates available are:

    -   is
    -   is not
    -   is empty
    -   is not empty
    -   is anything
    -   is one of: When you select "is one of", you can select multiple values at once. Type the first two letters, and select the **Select all** icon to select all matching values.\[Omitted image "filter-isoneof.gif"\] Alt text: Selecting multiple values for is one of predicate
    **Note:** OR condition can be used only for conditions within the same entity. \(State \(incident\) is Work in progress OR Assignment group \(incident\) is database\).

    1.  Define an activity by adding conditions that contain a field, operator, and values.

        Use the **Occurrence is** field to define whether the filter applies to the first, last, or all occurrences of this condition.

    2.  Use the **Add contextual condition** button to define additional contextual conditions for this activity.

        Use the **and** and **or** buttons to create as many contextual conditions as needed.

    3.  Select **Add next activity** to define another activity within this chain.

        After creating a new activity, a **Relationship** section appears between the two activities. This section defines the relationship between the activities immediately above and below it.

    4.  Select a relationship between your activities.

        -   Directly followed by
        -   Eventually followed by
        -   Not directly followed by
        -   Not eventually followed by
    5.  Select \(\[Omitted image "show-constraint.png"\] Alt text: Add activity conditions using the Transitions filter\) next to **No constraints added** text to edit constraints for this relationship.

        After creating a constraint, you can select \(\[Omitted image "hide-constraint.png"\] Alt text: Add activity conditions using the Transitions filter\) to minimize the constraint editor.

    6.  Select **+ Add Chain** \(on the top right\) to create an additional chain of activities.

        A chain is a set of linked activities. Create a new chain to define separate set of related activities that must also evaluate to true, but does not have a relationship with the activities in another chain. Once you create a new chain you can navigate between chains using the **Chain &lt;number&gt;** tabs at the top of the window.

    7.  When you have finished creating your filter, select **Apply** to save and return to **Analyst workbench**.

        The task runs in the background.

6.  When the task completes, select **View result** in the Scheduled tasks panel of Analyst workbench.
