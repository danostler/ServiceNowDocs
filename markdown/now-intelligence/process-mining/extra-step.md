# Configure extra step finding definition

Configure an extra-step finding definition to view a pattern where routes differ by one additional step.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_process\_optimization\_analyst, sn\_process\_optimization\_power\_user, or sn\_process\_optimization\_admin

Extra-step finding definition surfaces variants \(routes\) in the process that differ by only one additional step, which could possibly be automated or eliminated to save time.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to Improvement opportunity definition page.

    For information about Improvement opportunity definition page, see [Set improvement opportunities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/now-intelligence/process-mining/improve-opportunities.md).

2.  Select **Create** on the Extra step card.

    For a particular type of automated finding, you can create a maximum of two automated findings.

3.  Provide details in the **Define** section.

    For details, see [Rule-based finding definition form from Finding Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/now-intelligence/process-mining/finding-definition-form.md).

4.  Select **Configure**.

    The **Configure** tab is displayed.

5.  Fill the details on the form.

    Default values are provided. You can edit them if needed.

    According to the example, records that meet the following conditions are available as improvement opportunities in the Summary and insights page:

    -   Checks for variants \(routes\) with a minimum of 7 steps to find similar variants with an extra step. The steps include **Process start** and **Process end**. Also, the variants must have a minimum of 10 records.
    -   Only variants with 20% to 100% of the of the volume of the efficient route will be considered. However, variants with 100 records will always be considered irrespective of the percentage.
    -   Only top 10 variants will be displayed in the Summary and insights page.
6.  Select **Save and exit**.
