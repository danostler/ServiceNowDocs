</td></tr><tr><td>

Finding definition

</td><td>

Finding definition associated with this finding rule. This field is automatically populated.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Sequence

</td><td>

Order in which rules in the same chain execute. Rules with a lower value execute before those with a higher value.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Start condition

</td><td>

Event that triggers a finding rule. You may select an existing rule, or create one using the plus \(+\) button to the right of the field.**Note:** For details on creating a condition, see [Configure advanced conditions: crop process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/now-intelligence/process-mining/po-advanced-conditions.md).

Event that concludes a finding rule. You may select an existing rule, or create one using the plus \(+\) button to the right of the field. **Note:** For details on creating a condition, see [Configure advanced conditions: crop process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/now-intelligence/process-mining/po-advanced-conditions.md).
