# Run work notes analysis

Generate a work notes analysis on a transition.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_process\_optimization\_analyst, sn\_process\_optimization\_power\_user, or sn\_process\_optimization\_admin and you must have the `now.assist.creator` role.

**Note:** Work notes with more than 5 words and fewer than 100 words are considered for the analysis.

You can use the Now Assist feature for work notes analysis even with 5-50 eligible work notes. If there are less than 25 eligible work notes, the system will not run clustering, but will put all the work notes into one LLM call, otherwise clustering will be performed before calling the LLM.

**Important:** Now assists are charged dynamically.

-   For cluster based work notes, 250 Now assists are charged per request. There is no limitation of work notes per request. You can load more results for the same request with no extra charge.
-   For non-clustering LLM calls, 100 Now assists are charged per request.
-   If results are not displayed, then there are no charges.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workspaces** &gt; **Process Mining Workspace**.

2.  From the list of projects, select a project.

3.  Select any transition.

    A window is displayed with all the details.

5.  After the scheduled task is complete, select **View result**.

    The result is displayed.
