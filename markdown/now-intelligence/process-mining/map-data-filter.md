# Set data filter and map filter

Set the data and map filters to focus on the data as per your requirement.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_process\_optimization\_analyst, sn\_process\_optimization\_power\_user, or sn\_process\_optimization\_admin

There are two types of filters:

-   Data filters: Data filters are always applied before map filters. They can be applied in any order and the result will not change. They are unordered. All advanced data filters, breakdown filters, variant filters, findings, and Automation Discovery filters are listed as data filters.
-   Map filters: Map filters are applied in chronological order, with latest at the bottom. They are ordered. All transition filters, repetition filters, View and Crop conditions are listed as map filters.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Process Mining Workspace**.

2.  Select a project.

3.  Select the **Analyst workbench** tab.

4.  In the filters list, you see the filters that are applied to the project.
