# Installing Task Mining agent

The Task Mining agent is a service installed on workstations that logs certain events from desktop applications.

Role required: Task Mining Agent Install

**Note:** You must be a part of the Task Mining Agent Install group with roles itil, sn\_tm\_core.service\_user, and agent\_client\_collector\_admin to install the Task Mining agent. If the group doesn't exist, create a group with that name and those roles manually. For more information, see [Assign a role to a group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/platform-administration/user-administration/t_AssignRoleToGroup.md).

The process to install a Task Mining agent is as follows:

1.  Data log request is submitted by a Task Mining analyst or power user.
2.  The manager approves the request.
3.  Installation is performed by an IT or security user who is a part of the Task Mining Agent Install group with admin rights on the target workstation.
