# Change Models properties

Configure the Change Models properties to access the Change models capabilities when creating a Change request.

The following properties enable you to access the Change Models features. For upgrade users, these properties are set to **true**.

Enter `sys_properties.list` in the navigation filter and enter `*change_model` in the Search panel to view and edit the properties.

|Property|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|com.snc.change\_management.change\_model.hide|Hides the Change models feature when the **com.snc.change\_management.change\_model.type\_compatibility** property is enabled. When creating a new change, you do not have the option to choose a model, and the **Model** field is not available on the Change request form.|
|com.snc.change\_management.change\_model.manage\_workflow|Enables Workflow management support for ChangeRequest API if the **com.snc.change\_management.state\_model** plugin is installed. This will call the 'deleteDefaultWorkflowContext' method to be called on specific state and type changes.|
|com.snc.change\_management.change\_model.type\_compatibility|Enables Change Type Compatibility for Change models if the **com.snc.change\_management.state\_model** plugin is installed. When true allows changes to be created with both the type based workflow and Change models.|
