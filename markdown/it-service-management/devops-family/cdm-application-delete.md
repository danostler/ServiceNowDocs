# Delete a CDM application

Delete a CDM application to delete all associated config data and snapshots.

## Before you begin

**Important:** DevOps Config is now deprecated and no longer supported or available for new activation.

Role required: CDM Admin \[sn\_cdm.cdm\_admin\]

## Procedure

-   Disconnect deployables from CMDB services.
-   Return an error for any attempt to query associated snapshots.
