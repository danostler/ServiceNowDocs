# Resolve and close an incident

When the service is restored by rectifying the issue that resulted for an incident, you can set the incident state as resolved. If the user is satisfied with the resolution, the user can close the incident or the incident is auto-closed after a certain time based on the incident auto-close properties.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   For resolution: itil, list\_updater, sn\_incident\_write, or admin
-   For closure: itil\_admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Incident** &gt; **Open**.

2.  Open the incident that you want to resolve and close.

3.  In the Resolution Information section, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Resolved by|The user who resolved the issue and the date and time the incident was closed.|
    |Resolved|The date and time when the incident was resolved.|
    |Resolution code|Information to categorize resolved cases.|
    |Resolution notes|Document how an incident is resolved.|

4.  Click **Resolve**.

    The incident is in the resolved state.

5.  Click **Close Incident**.

    The incident is closed.
