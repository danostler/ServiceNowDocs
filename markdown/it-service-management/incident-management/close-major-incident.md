# Close a major incident

You can close a major incident manually after validating the resolution and when the major incident is in the **Resolved** state.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: major\_incident\_manager or admin
-   Major incident is in resolved state

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Major Incidents** &gt; **Open**.

2.  Open the major incident that you want to close.

3.  Click **Close Incident**.

    **Note:**

    -   If you cancel an incident and the major incident state is in **Proposed** or **Accepted** state, the major incident state changes to **Canceled**.
    -   The incident auto-closure property **Enable auto closure of incidents based on Resolution date. Setting this to 'No' will make auto closure to run based on the Updated date** does not close any incident record that is accepted as a major incident. Users with the major\_incident\_manager or admin role must close a major incident manually, after validating the resolution and when the major incident is in the **Resolved** state.
    -   If an incident was promoted as a major incident, then an ESS user cannot resolve, close, or reopen the incident.
