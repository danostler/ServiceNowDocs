# Close an incident communication plan

Close an incident communication plan after its execution or if it is no longer needed.

## Before you begin

Role required: itil, ia\_admin, or admin

## About this task

-   The business rule **IA\_State\_Management** allows any user with the ia\_admin role or an itil user who is assigned to the incident communication plan, to close or cancel an incident communication plan.
-   If a user with the itil role closes or cancels a parent incident, all related incident communication plans are closed or canceled.

    **Note:** Use the incident management property **Close open Incident Communication Plans when Incident is closed or canceled** \(**com.snc.incident.incident\_alert.closure**\) to control this behavior.


## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Incident Communications Management** &gt; **Open**.

2.  Open the incident communications plan record that you want to close.

3.  In the **State** field, select **Closed**.

4.  Right-click on the form header and click **Save**.
