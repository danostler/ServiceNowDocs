# Customize a Vendor Management Workspace page using UI Builder

Clone an existing Vendor Management Workspace page variant and customize it based on your needs using the UI Builder.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, workspace\_admin, or ui\_builder\_admin

## About this task

All UI Builder pages and page variants are read-only. You can copy a page variant and then customize it. You can create a page variant from scratch or use a page template. For more information, see [Create a variant of a page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/application-development/ui-builder/create-variant.md).

**Note:** After you copy and customize a page variant, any automatic updates applied to the original read-only page variant will not be applied to the page variant that you have customized.

To open your configurable workspace experience in UI Builder, see [Open a Configurable Workspace experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/platform-user-interface/configure-user-experiences/open-your-configurable-workspace-experience-in-ui-builder.md)
