# Configure a communication plan in Major Incident Management

Configure a communication plan and tasks for effective communication with various stakeholders about the progress, milestones, and issues related to the different stages of a major incident record.

## Before you begin

The Major Incident Management plugin must be activated in Service Operations Workspace. For more information, see [Activate Major Incident Management in Service Operations Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/install-mim-sow.md).

Role required: sn\_mim\_sow\_admin and sn\_comm\_management.comm\_plan\_viewer, or admin

**Note:** If you have sn\_mim\_sow\_admin role, you can access the MIM page in Admin Center page but to configure communication plans you must also have sn\_comm\_management.comm\_plan\_viewer role to access the specific communication plan table. For more information, see [Roles in Service Operations Workspace for ITSM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/it-service-management/service-operations-workspace/roles-in-sow.md).
