# Monitor Microsoft Teams call quality

Enable advanced monitoring of Microsoft Teams call quality with DEX for Microsoft 365. Track and analyze call performance for a specific user.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

-   Configure advanced monitoring for Microsoft Teams. For more details, see [Enable application monitoring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/enable-app-monitor.md).
-   Set up DEX for Microsoft 365 application. For more information, see [Configuring DEX for Microsoft 365](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/it-service-management/digital-end-user-experience-dex/configuring-dex-for-microsoft-365.md).

## About this task

View detailed metrics for a employee's Microsoft Teams calls, including call quality, network metrics, and session data for a particular user.

**Note:** All the data displayed in this page are based on the information received from Microsoft.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  In the primary navigation pane, select the Applications icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-applications.png"\] Alt text: The Applications icon.\).

3.  Select **Teams**.

4.  Select **Call quality** under **Application metrics**.

5.  Select a **User**.

    **Note:** Only users with a valid email address can be selected.

6.  Select a **Start date/time** and **End date/time**, then select **Go**.

    **Note:** The date range is limited to a maximum of 48 hours within the past 30 days.

7.  Select **Summary**.

    The following details appear:

    -   **Call Quality**: A Pie chart shows the percentage of calls with Good quality, Poor quality, or Unclassified.
    -   **Call Types**: A Pie chart shows the percentage of calls types: audio, video, or other.
    -   **Calls over time**: A line graph shows the number of Good, Poor, or Unclassified quality calls over the selected time period.
    -   **Network Experience**: A line graph shows average packet loss and average jitter over the selected period.
    -   **Metrics**: The following metrics appear in a table.

<table id="table_nrm_shz_nfc"><thead><tr><th>

Metric

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Average jitter

</td><td>

Measure of the variation in packet delay over a network.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Average packet loss rate

</td><td>

Shows how often data disappears on its way. Lower loss means better sound, video, and performance.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Average round-trip time

</td><td>

Average time it takes for a data packet to travel from the source to the destination and back again. The lower the round-time trip, the faster the network.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Average audio degradation

</td><td>

Average decline in audio quality experienced during a call or voice transmission, due to network issues like packet loss, jitter, latency, or codec problems.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Average video frame loss percentage

</td><td>

Average percentage of video frames lost as is displayed to the user.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Average bandwidth estimate

</td><td>

Average estimated bandwidth available between two endpoints in bits per second.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>8.  Select **call quality metrics** to get session details.

    A number of total calls, good calls, and poor calls appears with a timeline chart of calls. The following session details appear:

    -   **Session Quality Breakdown**: A pie chart shows the percentage of Microsoft Teams sessions with Good, Poor, or Unclassified quality.
    -   **Connection Type**: A bar chart shows calls from various connection types.
    -   **Media Type**: A bar chart shows audio and video calls.
    -   **Video codecs used**: A bar chart based on the video codecs used.
    -   **Audio codecs used**: A bar chart based on the audio codecs used.
    -   **Operating system**: A bar chart based on the user’s operating system.
