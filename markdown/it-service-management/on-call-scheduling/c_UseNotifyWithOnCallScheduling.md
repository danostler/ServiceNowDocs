# Setting up SMS and voice messaging as contact methods

To send On-call escalation notifications as SMS or voice messages, you must configure Notify.

Configure the following items to use Notify with On-Call Scheduling:

-   You must add at least one Notify phone number to the On-Call Group number group. This group is configured by default to handle inbound SMS responses \(via On-Call: Check Assignment Response\) that accepts or rejects an on-call assignment and to handle outbound voice calls \(via On-Call: Assign by Acknowledgement Voice\) to accept or reject assignments.
-   You must configure workflows, such as the On-Call: Assign by Acknowledgement to drive escalations via SMS and Voice.

To set up SMS and voice message as contact methods, see
