# Configuring On-Call Scheduling

Plan and configure On-Call Scheduling properties, templates, trigger rules, escalation policies, rosters, and schedules.

As an administrator, you can configure preferences and application behavior and create tools that improve the effectiveness of roster members and shift managers. These are some of the tasks you can perform as an administrator.

## Activate On-Call Scheduling

You can activate the On-Call Scheduling \(com.snc.on\_call\_rotation\) plugin if you have the admin role.

## Set up contact methods

You can configure the following contact methods and enable users to receive notifications for escalations.

-   Slack: You can also configure a template and subflow for user responses to the notifications.
-   Text and voice messages: You can configure phone number and workflows to drive escalation via text and voice message.
-   Microsoft Teams: Ensure that your ServiceNow instance is configured to integrate with Virtual Agent and IT Service Management integration with Microsoft Teams plugin \(sn\_now\_teams\_it\) is active.
-   Mobile push notifications: Configure ServiceNow Agent and enable mobile push notifications
