# Setup Workplace Connectors for Wi-Fi data

Configure workplace Wi-Fi data sensors to capture the data from Wi-Fi providers to optimize space usage and efficiently manage workplace operations. You can use Wi-Fi data to determine the occupancy of spaces and attendance of employees in the office.

Wi-Fi data integrate with access points, enabling the tracking of device connectivity and disconnection events. For example, laptops, and mobile devices.

**Note:** Workplace Connectors customers are expected to build their own business use cases for using Wi-Fi data records.

Configure the Connector Configurations table for loading the Wi-Fi data in the target Wi-Fi Access Data table \(sn\_wsd\_wc\_wifi\_access\_data\). The connector configuration table retrieves the data from different Wi-Fi data providers.

Configure the Provider Connector Configurations table for setting up Wi-Fi data in workplace locations.
-   **[Wi-Fi data table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/employee-service-management/workplace-connectors/wsd-wi-fi-data-table.md)**  
Retrieve the device name, access point, and connection date and time for a workplace location. The Workplace Connectors Wi-Fi data checks the occupancy of a workplace location.

Create a scripted extension point to process Wi-Fi access log data from the provider and convert it into a standard format. Confirm that each provider implements this extension.
