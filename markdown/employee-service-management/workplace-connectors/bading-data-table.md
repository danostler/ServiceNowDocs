# Bading data

The Badging Data \[sn\_wsd\_wc\_badging\_data\] is the target table that contains the employee badging data and employee access records.

## Before you begin

The **Process Provider Data Record** scheduled job runs periodically \(every five minutes\) and loads the badging data into the Badging Data table.

**Note:** The Employee Attendance Data table has been deprecated and a new table Badging Data table has been introduced to support MetricBase integration.

Role required: sn\_wsd\_wc.admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workplace Connectors** &gt; **Badging Readers** &gt; **Badging Data**.

2.  On the form, review the field details for badging data.
