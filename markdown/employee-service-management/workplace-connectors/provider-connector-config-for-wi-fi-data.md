</table>4.  Filter spaces using the **Space Filter Condition**.

    Select **Preview** to see the results that your filter condition query returns. Select the link to view the matched space records in Workplace Connectors.

    For example, select **Space** from the list. Select the filter condition as **\[is\]** and manually enter the spaces **A1.001, A1.002, A1.003**.

    When a row is created or updated in the space filter conditions, the space records that meet the condition are loaded in the Provider Space Mapping table. A business rule runs in the background to fill the selected space records in the Provider Space Mappings table.

5.  Select **Submit**.

    When records are updated in the Provider Connector Configuration table, the selected spaces or location records are updated in the Provider Space Mapping table. The location records are updated with the location hierarchy \(Region, Campus, Building, floor, and space records\).
