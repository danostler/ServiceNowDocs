# Working with approvers for a case in Agent Workspace for HR Case Management

HR cases can be set up to require approvals before it can progress to completion.

The HR service configures actions related to approvals. For more information on HR service configuration, see [Configure an HR service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/configure-hr-service.md).

When a case requires an approver, the request for approval appears in the approver's Employee Center or portal under To-dos.

In Agent Workspace for HR Case Management, the child tab **Approvers** lists all requested approvers.

## Multiple approvers

HR services can also have multiple approvers. When configuring an HR service, an optional configuration allows you to select approvers from the fields on the HR case. For example, manager of the Subject person can be selected as an approver. Using fields from a case provides maximum flexibility when assigning an approver. . For example:

When an approver is assigned from the case, it is possible that the approver may not be found. Following are a few circumstances under which the approver may be missing:

-   the subject person manager is the approver.
-   the Subject person's HR profile does not contain a manager.
-   the Subject person's manager recently left the company.

When an approver is missing, the following message appears:
