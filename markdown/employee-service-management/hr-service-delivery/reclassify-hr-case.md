# Transfer an HR case

You can create and use methods to reclassify or transfer an opened HR case from one HR service to another. Oftentimes an HR case opens as a General Benefits Inquiry. After investigating, you can transfer it to the applicable HR service.

The base system includes two scenarios that agents can use when transferring HR cases from one service to another: Reclassify and Standard.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>The following apply to both Reclassify and Standard transfer scenarios:

-   Fields from the current case are copied and moved to the new case.

    **Note:** The sn\_hr\_core.transfer\_case.ignored\_fields sys property can be set with fields that are not copied in an HR case transfer.

-   Work notes copy from original case to new case.
-   Attachments are copied and moved from the current case to the new case.
-   Previous interaction records from the current case are copied and moved to the new case.

The sn\_hr\_core.reclassify\_default\_transfer sys property determines the default method to use after upgrade. For more information, see [HR properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/t_HRProperties.md).

You can configure additional transfer case scenarios by following these steps: [Configure HR transfer case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/config-hr-transfer-case.md).
