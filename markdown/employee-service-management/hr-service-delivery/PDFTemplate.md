# Configure an HR PDF document template

Create or modify custom HR PDF document templates with your unique criteria. PDF document templates originate from Managed Documents and are either a fillable PDF with mapped fields or a standard PDF with an inline signature.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_hr\_core.manager

## About this task

**Important:**

Starting with the Zurich release, HR Document Templates is deprecated and no longer supported or available for new activation.

Use [Document Templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/document-templates-overview.md) that provides the latest experience for this functionality. For migration guidelines, see [Migrating from HR Document Templates to Document Templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/employee-service-management/hr-service-delivery/migration-hrdt-dt.md).

For deprecation details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support knowledge base.

With PDF document templates, you can take an existing document and reuse it with custom information from an HR case or any available table. For example, you can take a fillable PDF document from Managed Documents, and map fields to customize the document each time it is used.

The document must be a fillable PDF to map the fields to a table. See the Adobe home page and search for fillable PDF to learn how to create fillable PDF documents [https://www.adobe.com/](https://www.adobe.com/).

**Note:** Fillable PDFs presented to an employee does not save any data populated by the employee \(except for signatures\). Fillable PDFs are only used for mapping fields to a table.

Documents are uploaded and accessed from the Managed Documents application in the Documents \[dms\_document\] table. Documents are required to be published as a document revision before it can be accessed.

The base system provides the Non-Disclosure Agreement document template as an example of a PDF document template.

**Note:** See . Managed Document features
