# Activate scheduled job to populate to multicurrency fields

Activate and execute the scheduled job to map your costs and work with multicurrency.

## Before you begin

-   After upgrading from classic experience to the latest version, run this job once to populate the new investment currency fields for all existing projects. The job copies values from the corresponding demand currency or project currency fields. This ensures that financial data aligns with the updated multicurrency model.
-   Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

2.  Filter the Name field to locate and open **Update multi-currency fields to investment currency for existing demands and projects**.

3.  Select **Active** and on the Scheduled Script Execution form, fill in the details.

    For a description of the field names, see [Scheduled Script Execution form to generate labor costs for planning items](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/it-business-management/scenario-planning-in-spw/gen-labor-costs-scheduled-script-execution-form-spw.md).

4.  Select **Update** to save your changes and execute the job as scheduled, or select **Execute Now** to run the scheduled job.


## What to do next

When the job completes, review your project records to confirm that the investment currency fields are accurately populated.
