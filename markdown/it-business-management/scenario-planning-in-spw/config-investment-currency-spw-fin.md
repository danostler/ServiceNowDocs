# Configure multicurrency for planning items

Select investment currency as an additional currency, which can be different from your functional currency, to manage financial records of your planning items.

## Before you begin

-   You can define investment currency for planning items which do not have any financials records, such as cost plans, expense lines, benefit plans, and actual benefits. To define a investment currency for existing work, you should delete all the financial records and configure the investment currency.

## About this task
