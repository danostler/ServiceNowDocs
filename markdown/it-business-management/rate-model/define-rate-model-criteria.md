# Define criteria of a rate model

Set the criteria of a rate model by adding attributes from a set of predefined entities to derive resource hourly rates based on the criteria.

## Before you begin

Role required: pps\_admin or it\_rate\_model\_admin

## About this task

A rate model consists of one or more rate lines. Each line contains a unique combination of criteria values and the hourly rate of a resource. You define the criteria by adding up to 10 attributes from the following entities:

-   Demand
-   Group
-   Project
-   Project task
-   Resource
-   Resource Assignment
-   Resource plan
-   Role

You can select attributes of type String, Reference, Number, Boolean, and Choice.

## Procedure

1.  Open a rate model by performing one of the following actions:

    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Project Administration** &gt; **Rate Model** &gt; **All**.
    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Time Sheets** &gt; **Rate Model** &gt; **All**.
2.  In the **Rate Model Attributes** related list, click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

<table id="table_ygf_cv1_ffb"><thead><tr><th>
