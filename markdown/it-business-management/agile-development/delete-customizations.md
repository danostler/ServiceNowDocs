# Delete customizations before upgrading to Agile Development 2.0

Take complete advantage of enhanced functionality by deleting all your customizations before upgrading to Agile Development 2.0.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

**Important:** Agile Development 1.0 and its features such as Sprint burndown chart and release burndown chart are deprecated and no longer available. [Agile Development 2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/it-business-management/agile-development/agile-landing-page.md) provides the latest experience for supporting your Agile work methodology.

## Procedure

1.  In the Navigation filter, enter `sys_properties.list`.

    The entire list of properties in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table appears.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields as follows:

    |Field|Value|
    |-----|-----|
    |Name|com.snc.sdlc.scrum.pp.delete\_customer\_updates|
    |Description|Delete customizations in the Agile Development application from the Customer Update \[sys\_update\_xml\] table.|
    |Type|true\|false|
    |Value|true|

4.  Click **Submit**.

    All customizations would be deleted and the property also would be automatically deleted.


## What to do next

If the Agile Development 2.0 plugin \(com.snc.sdlc.agile.2.0\) has been installed before deleting the customizations, refresh the plugin by reinstalling it.
