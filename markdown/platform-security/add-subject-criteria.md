    |------|-----------|
    |Network Criteria|Allows access to records based on network IP range or IP subnet.|
    |Subject Criteria|Allows access to records based on subject criteria. Select a subject criteria record to apply it's conditions to your data filtration rule. For details on creating subject criteria records, see [Create subject criteria](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-security/df-create-criteria.md).|
