# Authorization code grant workflow

The OAuth authorization code grant is a secure and widely used flow for web, mobile, or desktop apps that access user data with user consent. It supports both private clients \(using a client secret\), and public clients \(using PKCE\).

## Before you begin

Role required: `oauth_admin, mi_admin, admin`

## About this task

This topic collection provides information on how a client application can use the Authorization code grant flow to obtain a token from ServiceNow and make API calls with that token. Private clients use client secret, while public clients use PKCE code challenge.

## Procedure

1.  Log in from the client application.

    The user begins the login process from the client application interface.

2.  Initiate the authorization request.

    The client redirects the user to the ServiceNow authorization endpoint. The method of initiating the authorization request depends on the type of client: Public or Private.

    -   **Public Clients**

        Public clients \(Example: Mobile or Single-page applications\) cannot securely store a client secret. Therefore, they must use **Proof Key for Code Exchange \(PKCE\)** to enhance security.

        -   In the authorization request, include the **PKCE code challenge** and specify the **code challenge method**.
        -   During the token request, the client must send the **code verifier** to validate the authorization code.
        Perform a GET request to the authorization endpoint with the following parameters:

        ```
        Method: GET
        Endpoint: https://<servicenow_base_url>/oauth_auth.do
        ```

</table>        **Note:** Starting with the Madrid release, the system property `glide.oauth.state.parameter.required` mandates the use of the `state` parameter in the OAuth requests. The `state` property is set to `true` by default in the new instances, and `optional` in upgraded instances. In case of missing `state` parameter, the authorization request fails and the following error is displayed: `Missing State parameter in request`.

    -   **Private Clients**

        Private clients \(Example: Server-side applications\) can securely store a client secret and do not require PKCE.

        -   The authorization request is initiated by redirecting the user to the authorization endpoint. **No client secret or PKCE code challenge is required** in this step.
        -   During the token request, the client includes the **client secret** along with the **authorization code** to obtain the access token.
        Perform a GET request to the authorization endpoint with the following parameters:

        ```
        Method: GET
        Endpoint: https://<servicenow_base_url>/oauth_auth.do

</table>3.  Log in and grant access consent to the client application.

    Log in to ServiceNow \(or IdP, if SSO is enabled\), and grant access consent to the client application.

4.  ServiceNow \(or IdP, if SSO is enabled\) validates the credentials and ServiceNow returns an authorization code to the client.

    After the successful authentication, the browser is redirected to the `redirect_uri`, and the authorization code is included in the query string:

    ```
    https://yourapp.com/callback?code=AUTH_CODE&state=xyz123
    
    ```

5.  Initiate the authorization request.

    The client redirects the user to the ServiceNow authorization endpoint for an access token. The method of initiating the authorization request depends on the type of client: Public or Private.

        Public clients \(Example: Mobile or Single-page applications\) cannot securely store a client secret. Therefore, they must use **Proof Key for Code Exchange \(PKCE\)** to enhance security.

        -   During the token request, the client must send the **code verifier** to validate the authorization code.
        The client sends a POST request to token endpoint with the following parameters:

        ```
        
        Method: POST  
        Endpoint: https://<servicenow_base_url>/oauth_token.do

</table>6.  Access the ServiceNow APIs with the access token.

    -   **Example:**

        Make a GET request to the APIs using the access token. Include the access token in the `Authorization` header.

    ```
    Method: GET
    End Point: https://<servicenow_base_url>/api/now/incident  
    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
    ```

7.  Renew the access token if it has expired.

    Make a POST request to refresh the access token \(private clients only\) with the following parameters:

    ```
    
    Method: POST  
    Endpoint: https://<servicenow_base_url>/oauth_token.do  
    Headers: Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    ```

    |Parameter|Required|Description|
    |---------|--------|-----------|
