# Explore Access analyzer

Analyze identities on the ServiceNow instance.

ServiceNow Access analyzer is an application that helps the administrators to view permissions for the selected user, role, or group.

**Note:**

-   Access analyzer is a ServiceNow Store product. Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) website to view all the available apps and for information about submitting requests to the store.
-   Access analyzer impersonates the identity record to retrieve details about the permissions and doesn’t read or store any personal or sensitive data of the identity.
-   Access analyzer evaluation results are the same irrespective of any access policies defined for the users such as Zero trust access \(ZTA\). The policies are only evaluated during the actual user login and aren’t evaluated during the access analyzer flow.
-   Access analyzer has limitations in accurately evaluating access of the resources related to managed scope resources and delegated developer.

## Evaluate Access

Evaluate Access is a capability of the ServiceNow Access Analyzer, which helps the administrators to view permissions for the selected user, role, or group.

It enables you to analyze and view the permissions of users, groups, roles for a table, client callable script includes, UI pages, and REST endpoints.

Using Access Analyzer, organizations can improve their security posture, identity governance, risk management, achieve their compliance goals, and understand who \(identity\) has access to what \(resources\).

## Compare Access

Compare Access is a capability of the ServiceNow Access analyzer V2, which enables administrators to compare user access and determine the right level of access for the users on your ServiceNow instance.

Compare Access can be perform between the users for the user records and access control.

Compare Access enables you to perform the following analysis:

-   Level 1: Compare user records to understand the attributes, roles, and groups.
-   Level 2: Compare access controls to run the root cause analysis by finding access issues.
