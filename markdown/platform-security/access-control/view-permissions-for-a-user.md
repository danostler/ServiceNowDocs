The following procedure describes the sample steps to view permissions for a selected user \(**ITIL User**\) to view the permissions of the **Incident** table using the evaluate access in Access Analyzer.

**Note:** Access Analyzer is a ServiceNow® Store product.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Access Analyzer** &gt; **Analyze Permissions**.

    The Analyze access and permissions homepage is displayed.

    |Analyze by \*|Select **User**.|
    |Select user \*|Specify a user name to select from the list. In this example, **ITIL User**.|
    |Rule type \*|Analyze access for a **Table**, **UI page**, **REST Endpoint**, **client callable script include**, **AI agent**, or **Agentic workflow**. In the example, `Table`.|
    |Select table \*|Specify a table name to select from the list. In this example, **Incident**.|

    The results can be read, by referring to the Legends, access control list \(ACL\), IAccesshandler, and Data filters.

    Let's take the example of **read** operation. For the **ITIL User** overall access is Passed, which means the user is able to read the record with the correct permissions \(ACL\).

    Similarly for **create** operation, the overall access is passed with an alert icon, which means that there could be a presence of script for the ACL evaluation.

    **Note:** In the example, **write** and **delete** operations are blocked for the selected user and the user can’t edit or delete the selected record \(INC0000001\).

5.  Select read operation to know more about the Debug logs.

    The Debug logs page displayed the business rule and associated ACLs that are required to perform the **read** operation for the record.

    The Debug logs shows that there’s a business rule and 4 ACLs associated for the read operation.

    There’s a status **Passed** for one of the ACL, which means to read the selected record, the user has the required ACL and can read the record. Since one of the ACL is **Passed**, the other ACL evaluations are **Skipped**.

6.  Select the Access Control that is Passed to know the details of the ACL.
