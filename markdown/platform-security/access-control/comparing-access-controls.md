7.  Select **Show role Hierarchy** to know more about the roles and groups the user is assigned and compare both the users.

    Based on the role hierarchy, you can assign the necessary role and group assignments to the user to have access to the resources \(table\).

    In the example, **Abel Tuter** doesn't have `itil` assigned. You can determine the necessary role and group assignments to the user by looking into the role hierarchy.

    You can select the node to learn more about the role, resources the role can access, or group.
