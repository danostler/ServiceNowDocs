# Removing Roles from users

Use the **Simulate Remove Role** for simulating the user's access changes for a resource \(tables\).

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, access\_analyzer\_admin

Enable the take actions. For more information, see [Configuring the Access Simulator \(Take actions\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-security/access-control/configure-access-simulator.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Access Analyzer** &gt; **Access Simulator**.

2.  Select **Simulate** from the Remove a Role from the user section.

3.  Specify the following fields for your simulation criteria:

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Select user \*|Specify a user name to select from the list. In this example, **Abel Tuter**.|
    |Select role \*|Specify a role to select from the list. In this example, **itil**.|
