# Required jms connection factories \[New in Security Center 1.3 and updated in 1.5 and 2.0\]

The **mid.property.jms.command.allowed\_factory\_names** property controls the Java Messaging Service \(JMS\) connection factories that the MID Server can use.

It is intended for a few select factories needed by plugins for JMS activity or action. Including additional factories could be a step in a chain of attack for vulnerabilities such as JDNI insertion that rely on capabilities an attacker can leverage in allowed factories. To prevent the possibility of any leveraged vulnerability, do not include factories beyond the necessary defaults.

To remediate this security risk review the list of names provided to the mid property, **mid.property.jms.command.allowed\_factory\_names**. Ensure any additional Java factory names beyond the default of connectionFactory, queueConnectionFactory, and topicConnectionFactory are necessary.
