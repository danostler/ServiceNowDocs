# Block rooted or jailbroken mobile devices

Secure your instance by preventing unauthorized access from jailbroken devices.

Use the **glide.sg.allow\_rooted\_jailbroken\_device** property to secure your instance from unauthorized access by jailbroken devices. If a user tries to authenticate into an instance using a mobile app while this property is set to **false**, they receive the following alert: `This device appears to be jailbroken and cannot be used to access this instance. Please contact your ServiceNow Administrator.` The app is frozen while the alert message is displayed, and the only way to dismiss this message is to select **Log out**. If this property is set to **true** users authenticate into an instance using a jailbroken device.
