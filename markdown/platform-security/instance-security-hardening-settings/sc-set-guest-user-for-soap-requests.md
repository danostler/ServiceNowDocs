# Set guest user for soap requests \[Updated in Security Center 1.3 and 2.0\]

Configure this property to control the level of access of unauthenticated SOAP requests.

This property controls the level of access of unauthenticated SOAP requests. If it is not set to the recommended value of **soap.guest**, or is set to a user with limited privileges, then SOAP requests will execute on behalf of the user. If this property is blank, then it enables unauthenticated access to administrator or maintenance level operations which negates all security controls within the instance.
