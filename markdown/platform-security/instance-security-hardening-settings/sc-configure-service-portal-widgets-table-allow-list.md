# Configure Service Portal Widgets Table Allow List \[New in Security Center 2.0\]

Learn how the **glide.service\_portal.widget.table\_allow\_list** property enhances security by listing tables accessible to unauthenticated users through Service Portal widgets, dependent on additional checks and specific glide property settings.

The **glide.service\_portal.widget.table\_allow\_list** property contains a list of tables that unauthenticated users can access through Service Portal widgets, which utilize the additional security checks in the SNCACLWidgetUtil script. This property is enforced only if the glide property **glide.service\_portal.widget.enforce\_public\_check** is set to true. Including unnecessary tables in this property may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. Nonetheless, Table ACLs will continue to be evaluated as they were previously.
