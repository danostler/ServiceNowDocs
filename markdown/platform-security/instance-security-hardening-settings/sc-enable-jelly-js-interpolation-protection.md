# Enable Jelly JS Interpolation Protection

Use the **glide.ui.jelly.js\_interpolation.protect** property to ensure that any JavaScript about to be executed on a Jelly page is protected from injection with the help of Jelly interpolation.

When you set property to **true**, an application goes through a Jelly script tree \(nested\). It wraps potentially dangerous Jelly expressions with a filter that:

-   Escapes their results to be safe, or
-   If their safety can't be guaranteed, generates a SecurityException because the expression that was going to be evaluated represents a possible security issue.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.

Functional impact

</td><td>

This property makes a best guess at whether an expression is quoted. It may wrongly quote legitimate expression. In that case manually marking an expression as safe may be necessary.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Security risk

</td><td>

\(Moderate\) JEXL injection is a form of input injection unique to the ServiceNow AI Platform that can lead to both cross-site request forgery and code execution. Completely turning off the protection may potentially open many P1 security vulnerabilities.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Workaround

</td><td>

To manually mark an expression as safe add SAFE prefix to Jelly expression:

 `${SAFE:sysparm_input};`

 Blindly adding SAFE to each expression is the wrong way to approach the problem, because it may open a security vulnerability.

-   Only add SAFE to an expression if you can guarantee that the expression does not contain input from the client.
-   If it does, it's possible for a malicious client to cause evaluation of privileged JavaScript.
