# Disable inbound emails for locked out users

Use the **glide.pop3.process\_locked\_out** property to control inbound email actions for locked out, active users.

Set this property to **false** to disable inbound emails for locked out users.

**Note:** Consider the security implications of allowing users from untrusted domains, and why they were locked out, before allowing emails from them to trigger inbound email actions.
