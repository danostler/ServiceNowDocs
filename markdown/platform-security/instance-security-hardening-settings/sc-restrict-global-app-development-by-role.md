# Restrict Global App Development by Role \[New in Security Center 2.0\]

Use the **sn\_g\_app\_creator.allow\_global** property to control which users can create applications in the global scope using the Guided Application Creator.

If **sn\_g\_app\_creator.allow\_global** is set to the recommended value of false, users require the **sn\_g\_app\_creator.global** role to create applications in the global scope. Conversely, if set to the insecure value of true, any user with the basic sn\_g\_app\_creator.app\_creator role can create global applications. Global applications lack scope protection, allowing developers access to extensive features and functions beyond specific scopes. Restricting global application development to users with the additional role adheres to the principle of least privilege.

**Note:** This property does not come pre-configured in your instance. You must manually create and configure this property according to your organization's needs.
