# Validate SOAP content type \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Use the **glide.soap.require\_content\_type\_xml** property to enable validation of a content type as text/xml and protect against invalid SOAP requests.

-   When set to **true**, the ServiceNow AI Platform validates the content type as text/xml and protects against invalid SOAP requests.
-   If set to **false**, any content-type value is allowed.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.

Functional impact

</td><td>

This remediation enables validation of SOAP content type for all the inbound SOAP requests. -   If you are using a content type other than text/xml for inbound requests, it may cause potential failure of SOAP transactions.
-   If you are not using the correct MIME type, it could disrupt third-party integrations.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Security risk

</td><td>

\(Moderate\) When accepting inbound SOAP requests, the appropriate validation is performed to ensure that the relevant content type is being defined as a part of the request. It restricts the invalid SOAP responses that can be viewed as a security risk.
