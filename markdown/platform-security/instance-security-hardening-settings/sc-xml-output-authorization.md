# Require authorization for XML output requests \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Configure this property so that basic authorization is required for all inbound XMLOutputProcessor requests.

If the **glide.basicauth.required.xmloutputprocessor** property is not set to the recommended value of **true**, then basic authorization is not required for inbound XMLOutputProcessor requests which could lead to unauthenticated information disclosure from the instance.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.
