# Enforce relative links \[Updated in Security Center 1.3 and 1.5\]

Use the **glide.cms.catalog\_uri\_relative** property to enforce relative links from the URI parameter on `/ess/catalog.do`.

The **glide.cms.catalog\_uri\_relative** property enforces relative links from the URI parameter on /ess/catalog.do. If **glide.cms.catalog\_uri\_relative** is not set to the recommended value of true, then the URL will not be sanitized with the enforceRelativeURL\(url\) function. Absolute URLs can pose a security risk when used as a part of parameter or a field value, thus redirecting the source page to an adversary-controlled website.
