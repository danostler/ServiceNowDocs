# Restrict HR case updates from personal emails \[New in Security Center 1.3and updated in 1.5\]

Use the**sn\_hr\_core.restrict\_guest\_email** property to control whether a user can respond back to a HR case with their personal email.

When the **sn\_hr\_core.restrict\_guest\_email** property is not set to true, a user can send an email from a personal account referencing the HR case to be included in the work notes. This could result in minor confidentiality or integrity issues if the personal email is compromised or communicating insecurely. An admin may want to restrict the ability of users to respond to HR cases from their personal email, since they cannot be confident of the user accessing the personal email account.
