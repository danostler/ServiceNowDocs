# Enable HTTP Only Cookie Flag \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Use the **glide.cookies.http\_only** property to enable the HTTPOnly attribute for sensitive cookies.

Use the HTTPOnly attribute to prevent attacks, such as cross-site scripting, because it doesn't allow access to the cookie using a client-side script, such as JavaScript. It does not eliminate cross site scripting risks but does eliminate some exploitation vectors.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.

Functional impact

</td><td>

This remediation adds an extra HTTPOnly flag in on session cookies, thus protecting them from being stolen. -   If you have custom functionality that requires JavaScript to access the user's cookie, it breaks that functionality. It should not be the case under normal circumstances.
-   The ServiceNow AI Platform handles session management and there shouldn't be a reason for a custom script to access the user's cookies.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Security risk

</td><td>

\(Moderate\) Session cookies in the application authenticate an end user and provide implicit access permissions on the application. That means there is a need to secure them from being stolen or exported. HTTP Only flags protect the session cookies from JavaScript injections or cross site scripting vulnerabilities stealing them.
