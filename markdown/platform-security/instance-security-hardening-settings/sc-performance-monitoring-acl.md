# Restrict performance monitoring access \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Use the **glide.security.diag\_txns\_acl** property to control stats.do, threads.do, thread\_pool\_stats, and replication.do access from an unauthenticated connection.

When you set this property to **true**, the **glide.security.diag\_txns\_acl** property only allows access to the following by the administrator account:

-   https://&lt;instancename&gt;.service-now.com/stats.do
-   https://&lt;instancename&gt;.service-now.com/threads.do
-   https://&lt;instancename&gt;.service-now.com/replication.do
-   https://&lt;instancename&gt;.service-now.com/thread\_pool\_stats.do

Without enabling this setting, it is still possible to access these resources from an unauthenticated connection.
