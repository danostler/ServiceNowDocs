# Disable logger for low privilege users in script sandbox \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Manage Glide System's ability to log scripts being executed in the sandbox environment.

Use the **glide.security.sandbox\_no\_logging** property to control Glide System's ability to log scripts being executed in the sandbox environment. If **glide.security.sandbox\_no\_logging** is set to **false**, logging is available for lower-privileged users using sandboxed scripts. This is a potential security vulnerability because low privileged users can inject logs allowing a bad actor to potentially obfuscate an attack. Configure the property to **true** to prevent lower-privileged users that are using a sandboxed script from having logging functionality.
