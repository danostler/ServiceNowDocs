# Restrict access to emails with empty target table

Activate the **glide.email.email\_with\_no\_target\_visible\_to\_all** property to restrict user access to emails, unless they were the one who sent the email or have an admin role.

Unauthorized users are able to access emails in the sys\_email\_list table that are missing a target record. Instead of enforcing ACLs on email entries, this property restricts access only to the email sender and users with the admin role.

**Note:** Emails sent to and received by the instance appear in the sys\_email\_list table. However, only received emails that were marked with an Error and Ignored state should have an empty target table.
