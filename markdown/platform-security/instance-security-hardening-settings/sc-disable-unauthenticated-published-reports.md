# Disable unauthenticated published reports \[Updated in Security Center 2.0\]

Deactivate this property to prevent the user from publishing or accessing reports. This property disables the published reports feature in reporting.

Enable publishing reports by setting the **glide.report.published\_reports.enabled** to **true**.

Ensure the Glide Property **glide.report.published\_reports.enabled** exists and is set to the value false. If the property does not appear in the sys\_properties table, add a new record.
