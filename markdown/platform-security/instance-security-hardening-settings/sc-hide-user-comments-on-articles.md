# Hide user comments on articles \[New in Security Center 1.3\]

Use the **glide.knowman.show\_user\_feedback** property to control whether feedback comments are visible.

When **glide.knowman.show\_user\_feedback** is not set to never, feedback comments will be visible on knowledge base \(KB\) articles to users with roles defined in the Glide property, **glide.knowman.show\_user\_feedback.roles**. As feedback comments may contain sensitive information, you may not want the feedback to be visible. If this property is not set to never, there could be confidentiality impacts if sensitive information is disclosed in feedback.
