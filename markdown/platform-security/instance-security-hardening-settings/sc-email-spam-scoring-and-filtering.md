# Enable email spam scoring and filtering \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Install the Email Filter \(**com.glide.email\_filter**\) plugin to install email filtering within the instance. This filtering identifies existing headers, which enables you to decide what to do with the email based on the associated header. Alternatively, set **com.glide.email\_filter** to false.

Every message sent through ServiceNow AI Platform email servers is assessed for the likelihood of being spam.

**Note:** If an instance uses a private email server, this topic is not applicable. For more information, see Email Spam Scoring and Filtering.

## Prerequisites

Before setting this property:

Set the **glide.email.read.active** property to true. To learn more, see Enable using your own POP3 server.

Functional impact

</td><td>

Email is never filtered, blocked, or quarantined from the instance as part of spam scoring. It is only scored and then sent on to the instance. All filtering is done within the instance with the Email Filters plugin.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Security risk

</td><td>

\(Moderate\) Email filters enable administrators to use a condition builder or conditional script to specify when to ignore malicious incoming emails from known/unknown sender.
