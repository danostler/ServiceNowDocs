# Restrict uploaded MIME types \[Updated in Security Center 1.3 and 2.0\]

Use the **glide.security.file.mime\_type.validation** property to activate MIME type checking for uploads. You can enable \(set the property to **true**\) or disable \(set it to **false**\) MIME type validation for file attachments.

## Prerequisites

Before setting this property, set the **glide.attachment.extensions** property. Only those extensions specified in **glide.attachment.extensions** are checked for MIME type during upload. To learn more, see .

Ensure the Glide Property **glide.ui.jelly.js\_interpolation.protect\_nested\_expressions** exists and is set to the value true. If the property does not appear in the sys\_properties table, add a new record.

## More information

|Attribute|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Property name|**glide.security.file.mime\_type.validation**|
|Configuration type|System Properties \(/sys\_properties\_list.do\)|
|Category|[Validation, sanitization, and encoding](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-security/instance-security-hardening-settings/validation-sanitization-encoding.md)|
|Purpose|To enforce checking of MIME type / magic bytes during file uploads.|
|Recommended value|true|
|Default value|true|
|Security risk rating|5.4|
|Functional impact|This remediation enables MIME type verification on the attachments to the application. No functionality impact, unless there is a malicious intent in uploading the files as this validation is merely checking for mis-sync between the MIME type and the data.|
|Security risk|\(Medium\) To reduce vulnerabilities such as file inclusion and malicious file uploads, MIME type verification should be enabled.|
