# Restrict unauthenticated access to attachments

Use the **glide.image\_provider.security\_enabled** property to control the security settings for images. If set to **true**, images are visible only to authenticated and authorized users. If set to **false**, images are visible to anyone with a URL to the attachment.

Secure the images on your instance to prevent sensitive information leak. Images on your instance are accessible via urls that end in `.iix`.

Set the **glide.image\_provider.security\_enabled** system property to **true** to prevent access to your images via these URLs.

**Note:**

This property is not honored for images from the attachment table if the origin table is one of:

-   Stationeries \[sysevent\_email\_style\]
-   Welcome Page Sections \[sys\_home\]
-   System Properties \[sys\_properties\]

Restriction should be applied for unauthenticated users as some attachments might contain sensitive information.
