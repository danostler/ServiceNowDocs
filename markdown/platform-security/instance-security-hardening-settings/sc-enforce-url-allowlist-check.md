# Enforce URL allowlist check \[Updated in Security Center 1.3, 1.5, and 2.0\]

Use the **glide.security.url.whitelist** system property to add extra layer of validation to ensure whether any external URL introduced should be a part of inclusion listed URLs.

Protect your users from client-side open redirection, which enable attackers to redirect your users to untrusted and malicious pages.

If **glide.security.url.whitelist.strict\_check** is not set to the recommended value of **true**, all external URLs are allowed for redirection as long as the **glide.security.url.whitelist** system property is empty. If **glide.security.url.whitelist** is not empty, then only external URLs listed in that property are allowed.

Set **glide.security.url.whitelist.strict\_check** to **true** or ensure that **glide.security.url.whitelist** is configured with the allowed external URLs to help secure your instance from open redirection attacks.

This property is applicable in the following cases:

-   `/logout.do?sysparm_goto_url={External URL}`
-   `/cms_login_redirect.do?sysparm_goto_url={External URL}`

Users are directed to an external trusted site after they log out of the instance:

-   `/logout_redirect.do?sysparm_url={External URL}`
-   `/saml_redirector.do?sysparm_uri={External URL}`
-   `/logout_success.do?RelayState={External URL}`

When SAML is enabled, it invokes an identity provider \(IDP\) logout URL.

Ensure the property **glide.security.url.whitelist.strict\_check** is set to true or the property **glide.security.url.whitelist** is set to a value.

Security risk

</td><td>

\(High\) Client-side open redirection can enable attacker to redirect victims/users to attacker-controlled website and is viewed as a security risk.
