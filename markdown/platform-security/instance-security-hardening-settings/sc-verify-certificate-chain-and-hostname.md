# Verify certificate chain and hostname \[New in Security Center 1.3 and updated in 2.0\]

Configure the **com.glide.communications.httpclient.verify\_hostname** property to prevent man-in-the-middle-attacks by ensuring that the certification verification process is executed.

When the Glide Property **com.glide.communications.httpclient.verify\_hostname** is not set to the secure value of true, the hostname and certificate chain presented by remote hosts during a TLS connection initiated from the ServiceNow instance are not validated. This could compromise the security of the TLS connection and allow person-in-the-middle attacks, where communications between two parties are intercepted. This may lead to sensitive data disclosure.
