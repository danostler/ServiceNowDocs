# Set minimal password length \[Updated in Security center 2.2\]

Set minimal password length to avoid compliance issues and reduce the risk of a successful brute force attack

Enforce a minimum password length of at least 12 characters to avoid compliance issues and reduce the risk of a successful brute force attack.

For every utilized Password credential store in use on your instance, ensure that a Password Policy is being enforced by selecting the **Enable password policy** field on the associated record in on Password Reset Credential Store \[pwd\_cred\_store\] table.

Next, open the record on the Password Policy \[password\_policy\] record table and set the **Minimum Password Length** field to at least **12**. You can find the associated Password Policy record in the **Password policy** field of the Password Reset Credential Store \[pwd\_cred\_store\] record.

For more information configuring a password policy, see [Enable password policies on your instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-security/authentication/enable-password-policies.md).
