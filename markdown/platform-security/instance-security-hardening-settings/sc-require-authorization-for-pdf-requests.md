Functional impact

</td><td>

This remediation enforces a combination of authentication methods, in the form of basic authentication and system level access control. -   It performs this authentication while retrieving data from tables/pages in the form of PDF data on the instance.
-   It restricts any guest users who are currently accessing this data. If applicable, you may need to create a new account for users who need access to this content, with necessary access control permissions.

 To learn more, see Web service import sets.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Security risk

</td><td>

\(High\) Without appropriate authorization configured on the incoming PDF requests, an unauthorized user can get access to sensitive content/data on the target instance.
