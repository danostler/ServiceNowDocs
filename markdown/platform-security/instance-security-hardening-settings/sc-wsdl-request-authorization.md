# Require authorization for WSDL request \[Updated in Security Center 1.3 and 1.5\]

Use the **glide.basicauth.required.wsdl** property to designate if incoming WSDL \(Web Services Description Language\) requests should require basic authentication.

If **glide.basicauth.required.wsdl** is not set to the recommended value of true, then , then this will disable Basic Authentication for WSDL requests. WSDL is a protocol that is used to describe web services such as instance table schemas, and is not a mechanism for sharing the data within tables. Setting this property to true allows for disclosure of table schemas to unauthenticated users.

**Note:** If you choose not to require basic authentication for incoming WSDL requests, you must modify Access Control \(ACL\) rules to enable guest users to access the WSDL content.

## More information

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.

Functional impact

</td><td>

This remediation enforces a combination of authentication methods, in the form of basic authentication and system level access control. -   It performs this authentication while retrieving data from tables/pages in the form of WSDL data on the instance.
-   It restricts any guest users who are currently accessing this data. If applicable, you may need to create a new account for users who need access to this content, with necessary access control permissions.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Security risk

</td><td>

\(Medium\) Without appropriate authorization configured on the WSDL web services, an unauthorized user can get access to sensitive WSDL content/data on the target instance.
