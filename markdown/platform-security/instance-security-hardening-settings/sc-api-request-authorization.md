# Require authorization for API requests \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Use the **glide.basicauth.required.api** property to enhance security for basic authorization for incoming REST requests.

Set the **glide.basicauth.required.api** property to **true** to require authorization for all REST requests. Set the property to **false** to bypass authorization for all REST requests.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.
