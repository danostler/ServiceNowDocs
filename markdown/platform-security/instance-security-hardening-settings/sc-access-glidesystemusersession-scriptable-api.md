# Restrict access to GlideSystemUserSession scriptable API \[Updated in Security Center 1.3 and 2.0\]

The client callable GlideSystemUserSessionSandbox scriptable API exposes GlideSystemUserSession's addErrorMessageNoSanitization and addInfoMessageNoSanitization methods to the JavaScript sandbox. This allows all users to call this method via script.

gs.addErrorMessageNoSanitizationMessaging\(\) and gs.addInfoMessageNoSanitization\(\) are used within the scripting environment for logging and notifications. Both of these are available in the sandbox if this property is not set to the recommended value of false. The sandbox is a low privileged scripting environment available to unauthenticated and no role users. Both of these methods can be used to display unsanitized input to a user. Displaying unsanitized input to the user is dangerous, as unsanitized input may contain dangerous code that runs in the user's browser. This can be utilized for traditional reflected XSS attacks. Reflected XSS attacks can be used in multiple scenarios, including session hijacking.

Set **glide.sandbox.usersession.allow\_unsanitized\_messages** system property to **false**. If there is not record of this property in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table, create one.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.
