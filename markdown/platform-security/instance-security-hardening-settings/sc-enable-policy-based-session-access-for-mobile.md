# Enable policy based session access for mobile \[New in Security Center 1.5\]

Use the The Zero Trust- Policy Based Session Access plugin to control if users authenticating through a mobile app will have their roles reduced.

The Zero Trust- Policy Based Session Access plugin enables security admins to reduce user access in a session based on parameters such as IP address, location, identify provider attributes, and user attributes with adaptive authentication policies. When this plugin is enabled or set to true, users authenticating through a mobile device will have their roles restricted according to the plugin's policies. Instance admins may wish to restrict high privileged access when users authenticate through a mobile device as it could indicate an unsafe environment for sensitive operations.

Security risk

</td><td>

-   Severity score: 4.7
-   CVSS score: Medium
-   Security risk details: If this hardening setting is set to true, then policy based session access is enforced on the instance for mobile logins, and users that are not coming from a trusted environment, or are not using trusted devices will have their roles with reduced privileges. True is the secure setting. If this setting is configured to false, then policy based session access is disabled, and users will continue to have full roles including the high privileged roles like admin all the time.
