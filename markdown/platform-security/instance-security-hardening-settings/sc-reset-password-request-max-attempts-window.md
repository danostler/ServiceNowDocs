# Control Lockout Time for Invalid Password Reset Attempts \[Updated in Security Center 1.3 and 2.0\]

The **password\_reset.request.max\_attempt\_window** property controls the number of minutes a user must wait to reset or change their password after exceeding the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts that is set with the **password\_reset.request.max\_attempt** property.

The **password\_reset.request.max\_attempt\_window** property defines the number of minutes a user must wait to reset or change their password after exceeding the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts that is set with the **password\_reset.request.max\_attempt property**. A small number of minutes for the **password\_reset.request.max\_attempt\_window** property increases the risk of successfully brute forcing a password as a greater number of password reset attempts can be made. The default of 1440 minutes is recommended.

Ensure the property **password\_reset.request.max\_attempt\_window** is set to 1440 or greater.
