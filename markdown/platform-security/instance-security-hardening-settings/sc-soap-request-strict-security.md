# Enforce SOAP request strict security \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Use the **glide.soap.strict\_security** property to enforces web service security.

This property uses a combination of:

-   Basic authentication challenge/response over the HTTP protocol and
-   System level access controls in the [Enable security jump start plugin \(ACL Rules\) \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-security/instance-security-hardening-settings/sc-security-jump-start-plugin-acl-rules.md).

If you set this property to **true**, it performs the following actions:

-   If the user has appropriate role to perform the operation, it checks incoming SOAP request for role authorization to validate. It occurs during SOAP web service calls/requests made against ServiceNow AI Platform tables when performing CREATE, READ, UPDATE or DELETE operations.
-   Checks the system-level ACLs while retrieving data in the form of SOAP data on the table.
-   Checks the field-level ACLs for any CRUD operation performed against a field of table.

ACL checks are only complete for standard Table API calls and not web services.

Functional impact

</td><td>

This remediation enforces the system-level access control while retrieving data from tables/pages in the form of SOAP data on the instance. If there are users currently accessing this data, they are restricted/allowed to access the data based on the ACL rules. For the default roles that have access to the SOAP data, see [SOAP web service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/api-reference/web-services/c_SOAPWebService.md).

Security risk

</td><td>

\(Moderate\) Without appropriate authorization configured on the incoming SOAP requests, an unauthorized user can get access to sensitive content/data on the target instance.
