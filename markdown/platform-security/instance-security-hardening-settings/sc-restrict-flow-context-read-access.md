# Restrict flow context read access \[New in Security Center 1.5\]

Use the **com.snc.process\_flow.reporting.require\_flow\_access** property to enforce if an additional access check is required for a user to read a flow check.

When the **com.snc.process\_flow.reporting.require\_flow\_access** property is set to the recommended value of true, there is an additional access check for a user trying to read a flow context. There may be minor information disclosure if this property is set to false.
