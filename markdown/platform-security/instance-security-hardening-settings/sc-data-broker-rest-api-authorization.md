# Require authorization for data broker rest API \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Use the **glide.basicauth.required.databrokerrestapiprocessor** property to require basic authorization for all inbound Data Broker Rest API requests.

If this property is set to **true**, then authorization is applied. If it is set to **false**, then no authorization is used which could lead to sensitive information being leaked from your instance.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.
