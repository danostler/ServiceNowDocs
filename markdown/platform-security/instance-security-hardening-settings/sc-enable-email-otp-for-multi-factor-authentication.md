# Enable email OTP for multi-factor authentication

Manage how two-factor authentication is applied on your instance.

Use the **glide.authenticate.multifactor.email.otp.enabled** property to control whether a token for two-factor authentication is sent using email. Email is considered a weak MFA factor which an attacker is more likely to gain access into for bypassing MFA. By setting this property to **false**, the risk of an attacker bypassing MFA when they compromised a user's password is reduced.
