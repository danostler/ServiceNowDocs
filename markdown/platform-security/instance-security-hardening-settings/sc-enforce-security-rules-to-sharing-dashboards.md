# Enforce security rules to sharing dashboards \[New in Security Center 1.3\]

Use the **glide.cms.dashboards.sharing\_with\_secure\_search** property to control whether users can share dashboards.

When the **glide.cms.dashboards.sharing\_with\_secure\_search** property is not set to **true**, users can share dashboard groups and roles that they do not have access to. Enabling this property enforces access control lists \(ACLs\) when searching the sys\_user, sys\_user\_role, and sys\_user\_group tables during the dashboard sharing process. Sharing a dashboard excessively can lead to users, groups, or roles accessing data that they should not have permission to view, potentially compromising sensitive information. Therefore, it is recommended to set **glide.cms.dashboards.sharing\_with\_secure\_search** to true so that dashboards are shared only with those who have the appropriate permissions.

Security risk

</td><td>

-   Severity score: 3.5
-   CVSS score: Low
-   Security risk details: Not setting this property to the recommended value of true causes access control lists to not be enforced when searching the sys\_user, sys\_user\_role, and sys\_user\_group tables. This could lead to dashboards being shared with unauthorized users, exposing sensitive information.
