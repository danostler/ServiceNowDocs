# Exploring Auditing

Track record changes on auditing-enabled tables. By default, the system tracks changes to the incident, change, and problem tables, among others.

## Auditing overview

Enabling auditing tracks the creation, update, and deletion of all records in the table. If you want to audit individual fields in a table, you can hide fields you don’t want to track using a dictionary attribute.

Auditing information is kept in the following tables:

-   [Audit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-security/servicenow-ai-platform-security/c_UnderstandingTheSysAuditTable.md)
-   [Knowing about History sets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-security/servicenow-ai-platform-security/c_HistorySets.md)

**Warning:** Auditing system tables that receive a large amount of traffic, such as workflow Contexts \[wf\_context\] or Event Management Alerts \[em\_alert\], can impact performance. For this reason, you can’t audit the em\_alert table as a whole. Instead, audit selected fields of interest. Set **audit=true** on both the em\_alert table and the selected fields. Try to audit as few fields as possible.

## Auditing users

Auditing has the following users.

-   admin
