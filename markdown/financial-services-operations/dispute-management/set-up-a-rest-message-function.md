# Set up tokenized REST message record

To use tokenized data with a Third-Party System, update the endpoint URL for the Third-Party System's REST message entry in ServiceNow.

## Before you begin

Set up your Third-Party System connections in our tokenizer service. For more information, see [Set up connections to the tokenizer service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/set-up-outbound-connections.md).

Install and set up integrations to the Third-Party Systems \(such as Visa Spoke or Mastercard Spoke\). Card Data Security requires these integrations to function correctly. For more information, see [Integrating with spokes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/financial-services-operations/financial-services/spokes.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Web Services** &gt; **Outbound** &gt; **REST Message**.

2.  Create a new REST Message record for your Third-Party System, or open the record if it exists.

    For more information, see .

    You will see records for Visa Resolve Online or Mastercom if Visa Spoke or Mastercard Spoke are installed.

3.  For the **Endpoint** field in the REST message form, enter the connection's base path from our tokenizer service.

    The connection's base path can be viewed in our tokenizer service administration website by navigating to **Connections**, expanding the connection, and selecting **Sample Request** on a route. The base URL is the domain name of the value in the **Path** field.

## What to do next

Repeat these steps for each REST message entry you need to set up.
