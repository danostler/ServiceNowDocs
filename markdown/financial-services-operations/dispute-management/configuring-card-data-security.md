# Configuring Card Data Security

Plan and configure your implementation of Card Data Security by following the tasks listed in this configuration overview.

## Configuration overview

Refer to the following steps to set up and configure Card Data Security for the first time.

1.  [Set up spoke integrations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/financial-services-operations/financial-services/spokes.md)

    Install and set up integrations to the Third-Party Systems \(such as Visa Spoke or Mastercard Spoke\). Card Data Security requires these integrations to function correctly.

2.  [Provision our tokenizer service and complete the onboarding procedure](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2238661)

    Ensure that you have provisioned our tokenizer service and that you have completed the onboarding procedure. For more information, contact your ServiceNow account representative.

3.  [Install Card Data Security](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/install-card-data-security.md)

    Install Card Data Security \(sn\_data\_sec\) from the ServiceNow Store.

4.  [Create the card vault table in the tokenizer service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/create-tokenization-vault.md)

    Create the card vault table in our tokenizer service. This contains the tokenized values from Third-Party Systems.

5.  [Set up connections to the tokenizer service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/set-up-outbound-connections.md)

    Set up the connections between your ServiceNow instance, our tokenizer service, and the Third-Party System.

6.  [Set up tokenized HTTP connection and credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/create-a-new-tokenizer-route.md)

    Define the connection and credentials in ServiceNow to communicate to the Third-Party System via our tokenizer service.

7.  [Set up tokenized REST message record](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/set-up-a-rest-message-function.md)

    Create or update REST message records for your Third-Party Systems.

8.  [Manage Tokenizer Resource Configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/financial-services-operations/dispute-management/manage-tokenizer-resource-configurations.md)

    Review the entries for each endpoint that sends and receives tokenized data, confirming that it is set up for our tokenizer service.
