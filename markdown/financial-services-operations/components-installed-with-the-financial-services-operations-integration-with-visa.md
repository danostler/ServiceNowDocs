# Financial Services Operations Integration with Visa subflows

You can use the following Financial Services Operations Integration with Visa application subflows to handle the card dispute management process.

## Financial Services Operations Integration with Visa subflows

**Note:** Use the decision table and Visa Token Service template to integrate your chosen Token Provider with Visa Integration subflows. This integration enables you to access Visa APIs, which might contain sensitive information. Make sure to use the subflow template for your Token Provider. This confirms that you detokenize data before sending requests to Visa and tokenize data after receiving responses, for a smooth integration with ServiceNow.

</table>## Batch queue APIs processing and scheduling

Financial Services Operations Integration with Visa subflows use batch queue APIs to process the dispute data on a set schedule. Batch queue APIs run at predefined time intervals, not based on user actions. You can set up and manage when batch queue API subflows run with the**Visa Queue Scheduler Flow**. By default, the Visa Queue Scheduler Flow is turned off. To start using it, activate the flow and choose how often you want the batch queue API subflows to run.

|Batch Queue|Description|
|-----------|-----------|
|Process Awaiting Action Disputes Batch Queue|The acquirer provides a dispute response, which places the Visa case in this queue. Processing this batch queue alerts the FSO case with the received response.|
|Process Incoming Pre-Arbitration Batch Queue|The acquirer submits a pre-arbitration request or response, which places the Visa case in this queue. Processing this batch queue alerts the FSO case with the received response.|
|Process Incoming Arbitration Batch Queue|The acquirer initiates an arbitration request, or the issuer submits an arbitration and receives an acknowledgment or decision from Visa, which places the case in this queue.|
|Processes Incoming Recall Batch Queue|The acquirer processes recalls at various stages, including dispute response, pre-arbitration, and pre-arbitration response, which places the Visa case in this queue. Processing this batch queue alerts the FSO case with the received response.|
