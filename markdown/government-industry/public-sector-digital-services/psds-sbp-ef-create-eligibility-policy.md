# Create an eligibility policy using the Social Benefits Playbook Policy as Code Engine \(PaCE\) Eligibility Rules Engine​

Create an eligibility policy using Social Benefits Playbook Eligibility Rules Engine​ to model eligibility rules that can be used to evaluate social benefit cases.

## About this task

Use Policy as Code Engine \(PaCE\) policies to build out the logic that will determine eligibility and benefits. Policies can be saved as templates to quick-start future policy creation. You can create a policy from scratch using Policy Management, and define the logic for that policy using the Policy Builder tool. Policy logic is a set of conditions that is used for determining whether or not an applicant is eligible for one or more of the social benefit programs offered by your agency. You can set conditions for the policy using the condition fields.
