# Configure approver groups for benefit eligibility determination in Social Benefits Playbook

Configure an approval user group for the Propose Decision Activity, so that the constituent’s eligibility determination can be routed to the appropriate people for final approval.

At the Propose Decision Activity, case agents need to decide whether to grant or deny benefits. An approver group needs to be configured, so that this decision can be routed to supervisors for review and approval. Create a scripted extension point to create an approver group for the Propose Decision Activity in the Social Benefits Playbook. Once the case agent makes a benefit decision during this activity, the case will be routed to the individuals in the approver group for review and approval.
