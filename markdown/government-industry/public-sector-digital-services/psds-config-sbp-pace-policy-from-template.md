# Create a PaCE Eligibility Policy from a template

Use an existing policy template created to quick-start the creation of a new eligibility policy with a similar set of data sources.

## About this task

Use an existing policy template created to quick-start the creation of a new eligibility policy with a similar set of data sources.

## Before you begin

Ensure the template is activated before. For more information on activating a policy template, see [Activate a Pace policy template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/government-industry/public-sector-digital-services/psds-sbp-ef-create-eligibility-templ.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  From the CSM Configurable Workspace sidebar, navigate to the **Policy Home** and select **All Policies**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Select the desired template.

4.  Update the policy details with the details of the policy you are creating.

5.  Select the **Policy Builder** tab.

6.  On the **If** form, fill in the fields.

7.  On the **Or** form, fill in the fields.

8.  On the **Then** form, fill in the fields.

9.  Select **Add else**, and fill in the fields.

10. Select **Save**.

11. Select **Publish**, and on the pop-up modal, select the checkbox for **Activate this Policy**, then **Publish without testing** to confirm activation of the policy.


## Result

The policy is now activated and can be used to evaluate eligibility for any open Social Benefits case. A version of the policy should appear in the Version Management tab, as will any subsequent updates to the policy. You can publish any version of the policy at any time.
