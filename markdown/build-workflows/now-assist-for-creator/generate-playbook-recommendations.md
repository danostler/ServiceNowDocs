# Generate playbook recommendations

Select the activity definition for a placeholder activity from a list of AI-generated recommendations. The system generates recommendations based on an activity’s name and description.

## Before you begin

-   Make sure the playbook recommendations skill is turned on. To learn how to turn on the recommendations skill for playbooks, see [Turn on Playbook recommendations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/build-workflows/now-assist-for-creator/turn-on-playbook-recommendations.md).
-   You can only generate recommendations for placeholder activities in a generated playbook outline. To learn how to generate a playbook outline, see [Generate a playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/build-workflows/now-assist-for-creator/generate-a-playbook-outline.md).
-   Role required:
    -   admin, playbook.admin, pd\_author, or a delegated developer permission

## Procedure

1.  In your playbook outline, hover over the placeholder activity and select the recommendations icon \(\[Omitted image "recommendations-icon.png"\] Alt text: Now Recommendations icon\) in the mini-picker.

2.  Select one of the recommended activity definitions, if appropriate.

    **Note:** If there are no recommendations listed, then no activity definitions are considered relevant to the activity name and description.

3.  Try updating the **Label** and **Description** to improve results.

    1.  Open the placeholder activity.

    2.  Update the **Label** and **Description**.

    3.  Under the **Activity definition** field, select the recommendations button \(\[Omitted image "now-recommendations-button.png"\] Alt text: Recommendations button\) to try to generate recommendations again.

    4.  Select one of the recommended activity definitions, if appropriate.

4.  Continue on with activity configuration from Step [8.e](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/build-workflows/now-assist-for-creator/generate-a-playbook-outline.md) of the [Generate a playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/build-workflows/now-assist-for-creator/generate-a-playbook-outline.md) procedure.


## Result

When your playbook's trigger conditions are met, your playbook runs. As a result, the system creates a Process Execution record and renders user-facing configurations for Playbook Experience. For an example of how to digitize a manual business process that renders as a playbook, see [Design an automated process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/build-workflows/workflow-studio/design-automated-process.md).

## What to do next
