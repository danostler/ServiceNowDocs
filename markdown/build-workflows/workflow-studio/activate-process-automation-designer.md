# Activate playbooks

Activate the Workflow Studio application to create flows, playbooks, and more for any of your use cases.

Playbooks are included with Workflow Studio, which is a ServiceNow AI Platform feature that is active by default, and that is available for installation and update from the ServiceNow Store. However, you can only trigger playbooks off of platform and application tables that you have access to. These can be:

-   Application tables
-   Custom tables that extend the application tables
-   Custom tables authorized by the application subscription

Each application subscription entitles you to create playbooks for its associated tables. Purchase subscriptions to access any additional tables that you want to trigger your playbooks from. If you already have a subscription to your application but you still can't create playbooks for your application's tables, enable the appropriate plugin.

**Note:** The plugins you enable determine which tables are available for you to create playbooks.

See the following sections to learn how to activate Workflow Studio Playbooks for your application.

## Activate Playbooks for App Engine

Activate Playbooks on your instance to create playbooks in App Engine.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

In order to create playbooks in App Engine, you must [purchase a subscription to the ServiceNow AI Platform App Engine](https://www.servicenow.com/now-platform/app-engine/pricing.html).

To purchase this subscription, contact your ServiceNow account manager. Your account manager can arrange to have the plugin activated on your organization's production and subproduction instances, generally within a few days.

If you don't have an account manager, decide to delay activation after purchase, or want to evaluate the product on a subproduction instance without charge, follow these steps to enable the **Process Automation Designer for App Engine \[com.glide.pad.license\]** plugin:

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Select **Request plugin** to open the **Activate Plugin** form on Now Support.

3.  On the **Activate Plugin** form, provide the following information.

<table id="table_awx_bhf_ygb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr id="target-instance"><td>

What is your target instance

</td><td>

Select the instance that you want to activate the plugin on.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Which plugin would you like to activate

</td><td>

Select the name of the plugin to activate.

 **Note:** If the system doesn't list the plugin you want or if you're activating the plugin on an OEM or on-premise instance, select the **Plugin I'm looking for is not listed** check box and then enter the name of the plugin.

</td></tr><tr id="date-time"><td>

Select Maintenance Date and Time

</td><td>

Select the date and time to activate the plugin.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    For example, see the following form to activate the Event Management plugin on an instance named SNC Instance.

4.  Select **Submit**.

    After the maintenance window, the system installs the plugin on your instance. To confirm the installation, go to the Installed tab in the Application Manager.


### Result

You can create triggers in Playbooks for custom tables that you create. Enabling the **Process Automation Designer for App Engine \[com.glide.pad.license\]** plugin lets you create playbooks for these tables and their extensions:

## Activate Playbooks for Customer Service Management \(CSM\)

Activate Workflow Studio Playbooks on your instance so that you can create Playbooks triggered by CSM tables.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### About this task

In order to create Playbooks in Workflow Studio that are triggered by CSM tables and custom tables that extend from them, you need to [purchase a subscription to CSM](https://www.servicenow.com/lpgp/pricing-csm.html).

To purchase this subscription, contact your ServiceNow account manager. Your account manager can arrange to have the plugin activated on your organization's production and subproduction instances, generally within a few days.

If you don't have an account manager, decide to delay activation after purchase, or want to evaluate the product on a subproduction instance without charge, follow these steps to enable the **Playbooks for Customer Service Management \[com.sn\_csm\_playbook\]** plugin:

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Select **Request plugin** to open the **Activate Plugin** form on Now Support.

3.  On the **Activate Plugin** form, provide the following information.

<table id="table_awx_bhf_ygb"><thead><tr><th>

Which plugin would you like to activate

</td><td>

Select the name of the plugin to activate.

 **Note:** If the system doesn't list the plugin you want or if you're activating the plugin on an OEM or on-premise instance, select the **Plugin I'm looking for is not listed** check box and then enter the name of the plugin.

</td></tr><tr id="date-time"><td>

Select Maintenance Date and Time

</td><td>
