## Changes in Zurich Patch 5

-   ****

    As of Zurich Patch 5, Developer Sandboxes will back up any update sets from the sandboxes and export them to the main instance.

-   ****
-   **[Exploring Code Signing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/platform-security/servicenow-ai-platform-security/explore-code-signing.md)**

    All the metadata tables with valid configurations are signed at build time using the Code Signing metadata plugin​ \(com.glide.code\_signing\). Installing this plugin automatically installs the Code Signing OOB App Signatures plugin \(com.glide.code\_signing.oob\_apps\_signatures\) which contains build time signatures for all relevant records in the trued-up ServiceNow® Store application versions. If you choose to sign tables, admin users with the Security administrator role have access to Code Signing job​s:

A requested item \(RITM\) created from an interaction in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\) with an HTML variable automatically re-attaches images from the variable as the current user

</td><td>

When a user copy-pastes text and images from Word, email, etc. to an RITM created from an interaction in a SOW HTML variable, reloading the RITM automatically re-attaches images to the record and gets displayed in the activity stream as a new attachment.

</td><td>

1.  Navigate to an Xanadu instance.
2.  Create a catalog item with one HTML variable.
3.  Open an interaction record from SOW.
4.  Locate and select the **Create Request** button.
5.  Create a request for the catalog item created in the second step.
6.  In the HTML variable, copy-paste text and images from a Word document or email.
7.  Submit the request.
8.  From SOW, open the RITM just created.

 Expected behavior: The RITM opens normally and images aren't reattached.

 Actual behavior: Images from the variable are reattached every time a user opens the RITM record. Newly re-attached images are shown in the activity stream. These images can also be found in the sys\_attachment table with Table sys ID = RITM sys\_id.

2.  Enable 'Ignore travel' in both dynamic scheduling property and task.
3.  Enable the 'Onsite arrival' status in sm\_config.

 Expected behavior: The user sees all dynamic scheduling logs.

 Actual behavior: There is no log displayed, and there is error message logged in system log: 'DynamicSchedulingProcessor: \_populateTravelTimeForAgentWorkBlock ReferenceError: 'GlideDataTime' is not defined.'

 Scenario two:

2.  Create work order task1.
3.  Assign task1 to agent1, with an estimated end time of 'one'.
4.  Create work order task2, which can only be assigned to agent1, and window start can only be after task1.expected\_start. This ensures task2 can only be dynamic scheduling assigned after task1 When task2 is in 'Draft' state.

User evaluation against audience on activity fails during rescind

</td><td>

This occurs because from the BR: Rescind Case Cleanup flow, 'current.subject\_person' is passed, which is considered a reference record in the initial flow \(Activity Launcher\).

</td><td>

1.  Create HR Criteria and add conditions on HR Profile \(on Any column and set user field on condition\)
2.  Create **Audience,** set the Audience Type = HR Criteria, and add the Criteria from Step 1.
3.  Make sure to add the created Audiences in Any Activity from Rescind Activity Set.
4.  Create a **New Hire Onboarding** case with subject person \(the person must pass the conditions in HR Criteria\).
5.  Make the case Ready for work and Assign this Case to an Agent.
6.  Impersonate as Agent.
7.  Navigate to the case and start work.
8.  After sometime select **Rescind**.
9.  Open the SubFlow: Evaluate Audience and open Recent executions.

 Observe that Flow Expects userID \(Subject\_person sys\_id\) as a string but instead gets Subject\_person GlideRecord. This subFlow later calls a method to evaluate subject\_person against Audience which also fails and gives the wrong result because of this.

The 'Truncate base table' job is created by a business rule: 'Table Rotation: Clean Base Table' on the sys\_table\_rotation table and it's scheduled to run in the future when all the rotations are completed.
