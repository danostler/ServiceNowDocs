## Changes in Zurich Patch 4

-   **[Sensitive data filters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/it-operations-management/discovery/sensitive-data-filters.md)**

    The Discovery Sensitive Data Filters \[discovery\_sensitive\_data\_filter\] table provides a way to help prevent sensitive information from being exposed in the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) by applying redaction rules during data collection.

-   ****
-   **[Show borders between search result cards in portal search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/platform-administration/ai-search/show-borders-search-result-cards-portal-search.md)**

    Display borders between search result cards on the search results page for portal search applications.

-   **[Time-based one-time password \(TOTP\) authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/platform-security/authentication/totp-authenticator-apps.md)**

    A time based one-time password \(TOTP\) is a secure authentication factor that verifies user identity by generating a unique, time-sensitive code.

-   **[Push notification - Okta Verify](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/platform-security/authentication/push-notification-okta-verify.md)**

    The **Okta Verify** app push notification enables users to securely approve authentication requests directly on their enrolled mobile devices.

-   **[Soft PIN authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/platform-security/authentication/softpin-authentication.md)**
-   **[SMS One-time passcode \(OTP\) authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/platform-security/authentication/sms-otp-authentication.md)**
-   **[Granular admin roles required to secure your instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/platform-security/servicenow-ai-platform-security/roles-within-platform-security.md)**

    Verify proper access management by assigning roles that define user permissions and responsibilities. By doing so, organizations can maintain security, enforce conformance, and optimize their operations effectively.

Database Persistence - Data Management

 PRB1952366

</td><td>

The 'Physical Table Stats Gatherer' job generates thousands of errors in the syslog

</td><td>

The following errors are logged in the syslog when the Physical Stats Gatherer job runs: Four entries are logged for each table which doesn't have peripherals attached to it, and one entry is logged per table that doesn't have stats collected by an SNC job.

</td><td>

1.  Make sure the SNC SDU job is running on the instance.
2.  Check the StatsGatherer execution for the day.
3.  Open syslog\_list.do
4.  Filter logs for message starting with: DATA MANAGEMENT TABLE STATS Gatherer.

Memory: Heap Space

 PRB1636231

</td><td>

Memory exhausted by the Archiver Job Consumer due to syslog records stored in memory, and syslog\_awa is not configured as a rotated table

</td><td>

Memory exhausted by the Archiver Job Consumer reparenting records from syslog table due to a problem observed when syslog\_awa, which is a child table of syslog, is created without table rotation. The archiver job reparents records for the archive rules it triggers for, and will reparent a table that's not rotated. When syslog\_awa isn't configured as a rotated table, the reparenting process will execute on it and its parent table syslog. Query to syslog shards are then observed, and memory is consumed as the records on these shards are stored into memory. Due to the size of it, it will cause memory to become depleted. When the archiver job is running, the localhost logs will have a large query to a syslog shard where the function reparentDocumentIDRecords is running.

 [KB2631388](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB2631388)

</td><td>

Activity Stream caches excessive records, causing sys\_activity table growth and performance degradation

</td><td>

Instead of caching only viewed entries, the platform may proactively cache all work notes and events generated on monitored tables, including those that are never accessed through the UI. This behavior results in rapid growth of the sys\_activity table, sometimes reaching tens or hundreds of millions of records.

</td><td>

Refer to the listed KB article for details.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Advanced Work Assignment

 PRB1933671

</td><td>

AWA \(Advanced Work Assignment\) uses the system locale timezone when writing to logs

</td><td>

The AWAEventUtil code changes the global locale setting, causing the 'localhost log' to be written in UTC rather than PST \(standard\).

</td><td>

1.  Log in to an instance.
2.  Install the Advanced Work Assignment \(AWA\) plugin.
3.  Navigate to **Advanced Work Assignment** &gt; **Service Channels** &gt; **New**.
4.  Enter the following values:
    1.  Name: test
    2.  Index order: 100
    3.  Table: Incident
    4.  Utilization condition: Short Description is not empty
5.  Submit it.
6.  Ensure that the channel is active.

19. Have the terminal open for all the nodes.
20. Tail the localhost log.
21. Navigate to **Incident** &gt; **Create New**.
22. Enter in something.
23. Submit it.

 Observe that the timestamp zone has changed, and some lines are in the previous timezone and others are in UTC.

Advanced Work Assignment

 PRB1935541

</td><td>

Work item incorrectly moved to cancelled state instead of queued state

</td><td>

Without external routing, the rejected work item should move to the queued state. Instead, the work item moves to the cancelled state, and the interaction moves to closed\_abandoned.

</td><td>

1.  Change mweb sys\_cs\_channel to type 'Messaging'.
2.  Enable external routing for 'Chat - Asynchronous' Channel.
3.  Mark Chat Async Queue 'external' as true.
4.  Make two external agents available in workspace
5.  As a system admin, start a chat in the SP/CSM portal.

Once routing to live agent starts, a new work item is created.

6.  Assign the work item to the first agent using manual assignment API via REST API explorer.
7.  Change the first agent presence to offline.
8.  Send a message from admin.

The conversation is reassigned, which moves the interaction state to New and creates a new work item.

9.  Assign the new work item to the second agent using manual assignment API via REST API explorer.
10. Reject the work item.

 Expected Behavior: Without external routing, the work item is moved to the queued state, looking for new agent.

 Actual Behavior: The new work item moves to the cancelled state, and the interaction moves to closed\_abandoned.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Advanced Work Assignment

 PRB1950558

</td><td>

Advanced Work Assignment \(AWA\) should be able to determine if the work item is rejected due to time out or Asynchronous Message Bus \(AMB\) disconnection

</td><td>

When the work item times out, the work item reason on the awa\_work\_item\_rejection table is 'Timed out' instead of 'AMB connection lost'.

</td><td>

1.  Install the Agent Chat plugin with the demo data.
2.  Open the AWA assignment rule.
3.  Update the timeout time to 15 seconds.
4.  Open a browser \(browser 1\).
5.  Log in to the workspace as an agent in browser 1.
6.  Open another browser \(browser 2\).
7.  Log in to the instance as a requestor.
8.  Open the URL $sn-va-web-client-app.do in browser 2.
9.  In browser 1, close the workspace tab completely as an agent.

Notice that the agent presence will not be set to offline immediately because the default idle check gives a 5 min buffer, and the agent is still available to receive work item at the moment.

10. In browser 2, start the live agent handoff.
11. Wait for 15 seconds so the work item will be timed out.
12. As an admin, navigate to the awa\_work\_item\_rejection table.
13. Check the rejection record for the previous interaction.

 Expected behavior: The reason should be 'AMB connection lost'.

 Actual behavior: The rejection reason is 'Timed out'.

Agent Chat

 PRB1943902

</td><td>

Create a new exclusive channel to receive work items on Agent Chat

</td><td>

The inbox component should subscribe to a new Asynchronous Message Bus \(AMB\) channel other than the existing AWA/work\_item channel to reduce the chance of being interfered with by other components subscribing to the same channel. The AMB publish function used in the workItemResponder should be updated to take the trace id.

AWA workitemResponder onChange published message causes a work item card to disappear in the workspace

</td><td>

Work items disappear from the inbox even though they are still pending for acceptance.

</td><td>

1.  Log in to one browser as an agent.
2.  Have multiple sessions as the requester and start chatting with the agent.

In the agent browser, observe multiple work items pending for accept in the inbox.

3.  Navigate to the awa\_work\_item table and update one of the pending accept work item.

 Expect behavior: The agent receives an AMB message about the updated work item, but all the pending accept work items remain the same.

 Actual behavior: All the other work items disappear from the inbox even though they are still pending for acceptance. Only the one that was just updated remains in the inbox.

Data is lost when updating the offline cache during online operations

</td><td>

While offline and on mobile, data is lost when updating the offline cache during online operations such as viewing screens or performing actions. This happens because the first screen updates information for the dot-walked \(referenced\) fields record, but the document doesn't contain all the information for all the fields for the referenced fields record. Null is filled in the database update for any field for which there isn't information.

</td><td>

1.  Set up two screens:
    1.  Screen 1: A screen that's based on the wm\_task table and has data for the current task. It should also have data for a reference field, which is also based on wm\_task. \(The referenced record on wm\_task will only display 2 fields via dot-walk.\)
    2.  Screen 2: A screen that's based on the wm\_task table and displays referenced records from the record in the above screen. This screen should have a condition on fields not included in the above screen.
2.  Log in to the application.
3.  Download a cache and don't go offline.
4.  Navigate to Screen 1's detail screen.

Observe that the offline cache updates for the current screen and referenced records.

5.  Navigate to settings.
