CMDB Query Builder

 PRB1977703

 [KB2727703](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2727703)

</td><td>

Query Builder in V2 mode can cause memory issues due to a static variable

</td><td>

An internal variable which is declared as static keeps being appended and thus creates a large memory footprint. This would happen if one or more queries are executed enough times to bloat this variable.

</td><td>

Refer to the listed KB article for details.

Database Persistence - Data Management

 PRB1988503

 [KB2764725](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2764725)

</td><td>

Active subflow executions with clean parent flow executions are listed as 'Unreferenced Records' and are deleted by DMUnreferenced RecordCleaner

</td><td>

This issue was observed in Zurich. If a parent flow completes while an associated asynchronous subflow continues running, the completed parent flow context is cleaned up by the retention policy by routine system cleanup. As a result, the running subflow becomes unreferenced, and may be removed during routine system cleanup.

Refer to the listed KB article for details.

Flow Engine

 PRB1935825

</td><td>

Skip\_schedule\_cleanup is not reset to false for subflows

</td><td>

The table cleaners need to be revised.

</td><td>

Open http://localhost:8080/ sys\_auto\_flush\_list.do? sysparm\_query=conditionsLIKEskip \_schedule\_cleanup &amp;sysparm\_view=.

 Observe that all the table cleaners use skip\_schedule\_cleanup. Skip\_schedule\_cleanup should be managed well.
