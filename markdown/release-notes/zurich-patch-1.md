    Subject ClaimField in the User \(sys\_user\) table that's used to populate the value of the subject \(sub\) claim of a JWT token. The sub claim is a piece of information that identifies the subject, or user, of the JWT token. This field only applies if the **Token Format** is JWT.

    This patch includes the May Maintenance update script in the form of a script include \(QueryRangeACLAuditor\). This script is not triggered automatically and must be run after a patch upgrade. More details on running the QueryRangeACLAuditor and its functionality can be found in [KB2046494](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2046494).

Application Manager

 PRB1907408

</td><td>

A rollback blocking the install/upgrade for non-global scope users in a domain-separated instance

</td><td>

Non-global domain users have been blocked from being able to install/upgrade on domain-separated instances. There is now a fix to allow this behavior and hence this code change made on App Manager can now be rolled back.

CMDB Query Builder

 PRB1910646

</td><td>

A large query from Query Builder may lead to excessive memory utilization on a server

</td><td>

A large query from the Query Builder module \(involving &gt;200 union of cmdb and cmdb\_rel\_ci, or &gt;100 unions of large tables\) from an internal instance was seen to have caused a large spike in memory utilization on a database server, causing degradation/performance impact.

</td><td>

 

</td></tr><tr><td>

Database Indexes

 PRB1901971

 [KB2206973](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB2206973)

</td><td>

A missing index on the 'sys\_id' column of the 'cmdb\_qb\_result \_base' table causes a replication lag when the table size is large

</td><td>

The index on the 'sys\_id' column of the 'cmdb\_qb\_result\_base' table is missing on 14000+ instances. Due to this missing index, when 'Table Cleanup on Query Status' \(qb\_query\_status\) table is triggered on such instances, it can lead to replication lag issues, especially when large volumes of records need to be deleted from the qb\_query\_status table. This can lead to memory exhaustion, and records are not properly cleaned up.

Internationa lization Features

 [KB2266945](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB2266945)

</td><td>

The 'Translated Text Synchronize' business rule has an infinite loop against v\_plugin

</td><td>

The 'Translated Text Synchronize' business rule goes in an infinite loop. The virtual table v\_plugin \(or any virtual table\) can refresh \(delete and insert of records\) the table upon query. Since v\_plugin has translated fields, glideRecord insert tries to insert into the sys\_translated\_text table, which runs the 'Translated Text Synchronize' business rule. This business rule tries to query the owner table \(for example, v\_plugin again, which can trigger the refresh again and this goes on in an infinite loop\). This is causing performance impact against many instances.

</td><td>

Refer to the listed KB article for details.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Record Watcher

 PRB1894715

</td><td>

ChecklistItem Responder is too slow to effectively scale with normal usage of the platform, leading to the record watcher queue becoming backlogged

</td><td>

A performance issue has been identified related to checkLitsItem responders and ACL \(Access Control List\) checks while creating checkListItems in Visual Task Board's cards. These issues caused delays, especially when tasks had more than 50 checklist items. This is primarily because getItemsByChecklistId\(\) is invoked every time a checklist item is added or a card is moved between lanes. It loops through all items under a checklist and performs individual ACL evaluations \(read/delete access\). These checks result in: Repeated database lookups, redundant ACL checks for the same parent checklist, and slower response times, especially when checklist items exceed 50.

UI Form Administration

 PRB1919041

</td><td>

An empty and read-only 'Template value' input field causes an error when saving a record: 'Cannot read properties of null \(reading 'hasChildNodes'\)'

</td><td>

To reproduce, users need a record with an input field of type 'Template Value', that is empty and also read-only. The error shows when saving the record.

</td><td>

1.  Log in as an admin.
2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **incident.CONFIG**.
3.  Add a field called **Test Template**.
4.  Make it of the type 'Template Value' and save.
5.  Select the 'Advanced' view and the 'Dependent Field' tab.
6.  Select 'Use dependent field' and a field, such as 'Channel'.
7.  Save the changes.
8.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **incident.CONFIG**.
9.  Create a UI Policy that will always make the new template value field read-only.
10. Pick an existing incident.
11. Make a change to the **Short description** field and save.

 Expected behavior: The record should save without error.

 Actual behavior: There's an error: 'Cannot read properties of null \(reading 'hasChildNodes'\)'.

Cache

</td><td>

File handlers are left open if a LazyInputStream is closed before being read by LargeContent DiskCache

</td><td>

If LazyInput\#close is called before the internal StreamSupplier is opened by LazyInputStream\#stream, the InputStream remains open until finalizers are calling during garbage collection. File handles are leaked when using LargeContentDiskCache and only call getMetadata\(\) or contentExists\(\). Because the supplier is never invoked and the stream is never opened, closing the LazyInputStream doesn't close the underlying FileInputStream. These leaked file handles are only released when the garbage collector runs finalizers.

</td><td>

There may be exceptions that are thrown in the normal operation of configuring or operating Workflow Data Fabric \(WDF\) tables and sources and these exceptions are expected to be logged into the 'df\_log' table. The WDF error logging framework is designed to translate these types of exceptions to some well-defined log category values. In some cases, this isn't happening. Additionally, when errors are thrown and a log category is known, a sysevent is fired so other components in WDF can react to the problems. This makes it harder for WDF admins to know what the problem is when they are looking at the 'df\_log' table and also prevents some actions where they would be able to solve the problem by themselves without support assistance.

The Now Assist flow builder bypasses system rules

It's not possible for the user to create a manual flow with a trigger on the 'sys\_update\_set' table. This is because of the system property 'glide.ui.permitted\_table.' However, the user can use the Now Assist flower builder to automate the creation of the flow without any challenges.

On Red Hat, an undetermined reason is caused by an incorrect 'Virtualized By' relationship

A virtual device should have a 'Virtualized By' relationship to a host, but if the 'Virtualized By' is connected to a virtual instance, it's considered as an incorrect relationship. When a virtual install of Red Hat is on a Virtual Machine with an incorrect virtualized by relationship, there's an undetermined reason created for the install. This is because the incorrect VM-host relationship prevented the install to be added in the 'samp\_vminstall\_on\_pinstall' view, so it can't be found when processing the installs in SamNewRedHat PerSocketPair LicenseCalculator. As a result, the install cannot be reconciled by the calculator and is stamped as 'undetermined'.

Some users on Portal have over 1 million of /api/now/v1/cs/ consumerAccount /unreadMessage call observers in the node logs.
