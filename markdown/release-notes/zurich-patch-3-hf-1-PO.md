Granular Delegation

 PRB1914000

</td><td>

Adhoc Granular Delegation intermittently doesn't work

</td><td>

This issue only happens when the delegation rule condition is added on the child table of the task field, which is added on the delegation rule.

</td><td>

1.  Activate the Granular Delegation plugin.
2.  Create the delegation rule table on the change\_request table.
3.  Choose the second step table.
4.  Set the filter to active = true.
5.  Select the **Assignments** and **Approvals** check boxes.
6.  Log in as an admin.
7.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **change\_request.list**.
8.  Create a new change request \(Normal\) with the Assignment group as 'Hardware'.
9.  Assign it to David Loo.
10. Change the state of the change request to 'Assess'.
11. Impersonate the user David Loo.
12. Navigate to **All** &gt; **Employee Center**.
13. Select **My Tasks**.
14. In the Open Tasks list, find the newly created change request.
15. Select **Delegate this task**.
16. Delegate it to Luke Wilson, with the start date as yesterday and the end date as tomorrow.

 Expected behavior: The UI shows the task as delegated to Luke Wilson with an option to edit.

 Actual behavior: The user sees a 'Success', but the UI still shows the 'Delegate this task' link.
