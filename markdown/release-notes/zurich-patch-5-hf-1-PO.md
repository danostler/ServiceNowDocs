Analytics Data API

 PRB1931476

</td><td>

Issue with Incident SLA donut translation in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\)

</td><td>

After changing the language in SOW, the Incident SLA widget appears as 'Breached'. After clearing the cache, it then appears as 'undefined'.

</td><td>

1.  Impersonate a user.
2.  Open SOW.

Notice that the Incident SLA widget label appears as 'Breached'.

3.  Change the language to any language.

Notice that the label still appears as 'Breached'.

4.  Clear the cache by cache.do.

 Notice that the label now appears as 'undefined' while the translation is already added in the sys\_ui\_message table.

</td><td>

1.  Open any visualization.
2.  Select **Schedule**.
3.  Select the file type as PPT or PDF.
4.  Fill the Reoccurrence, Recipients and Subject.

</td><td>

Column filter issue in the Data Visualization library page, in which the 'Does Not contain' is not working on the 'Owner' column

</td><td>

Applying the 'Does not contain' filter on the 'Owned by' column does not filter the records properly.

</td><td>

1.  Navigate to the Data visualization library page.
2.  Apply the 'Does not contain' filter on the 'Owned by' column.

 Expected behavior: All the records should be filtered by the applied filter value.

 Actual behavior: It is not filtered properly when there are multiple values.
