Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\)

 PRB1930654

</td><td>

The legacy health dashboard doesn't tell the user that the dashboard is deprecated/no longer supported

</td><td>

Users have bookmarked, saved, or edited links to the legacy health dashboard, meaning they can still access it. There's a lot of confusion on why the dashboard is no longer working as intended. There should be a message to tell the user this dashboard has been migrated to CMDB Workspace.

</td><td>

1.  Check out a Washington DC instance.
2.  Make a favorite for Health Dashboard - CMDB view.
3.  Upgrade the instance to X+.
4.  Select the bookmark for the CMDB view.

 Expected behavior: When users navigate to the legacy dashboard, they should be able to see a message telling them to use the new health dashboard and that the legacy dashboard is no longer supported.

 Actual behavior: See that the legacy health dashboard has some broken widgets, no colors, etc., but there is no indication that this dashboard is retired or has been migrated.

Advanced Work Assignment for Case Service channel

 PRB1946390

</td><td>

The case task isn't working properly for CCaaS external routing

</td><td>

The assignment isn't happening since there's no mapping field available for CCaaS partners to use and store their external ID onto the 'Case task' table.

</td><td>

1.  Configure the instance to route the case tasks through external CCaaS.
2.  Create a case task in the instance.
3.  The case task should be routed to the agent using the external routing mechanism.

 Expected behavior: The case task should be picked up by the CCaaS events and assigned to the identified agent. Further events should also be triggered for this task.

 Actual behavior: Currently the case task doesn't get assigned to the agent.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Advanced Work Assignment

 PRB1938992

</td><td>

High AWA assignment cycle times for impact voice call routing

</td><td>

A user is uptaking in NVC and they are facing slow response times for call routing. It's taking ~12 seconds to route the call to agent. Each AWA assignment cycle is taking ~11 secs and out of which ~8 secs is being spent for Agent Map creation. Expected response times should be less than a second as there's no other load in the system.

</td><td>

 

</td></tr><tr><td>

Advanced Work Assignment

 PRB1942061

</td><td>

Lack of ability to track end-to-end AWA Assignment times

</td><td>

There's currently a gap in performance measurement of the AWA offer work API and manual assignment API, where there is no way to accurately determine the time difference between when an external AWA assignment API call was made and when the work item assigned\_to would be updated to the assigned agent. The admin lacks context as to when the request actually gets processed and the work item gets assigned \(and by extension, the inbox card shows up in the agent's inbox\). Another limitation with the current design is that it only persists the offered\_on for the final API invocation, which led to work item acceptance. If there were multiple agents which were offered the work item via these APIs, this context is lost.

</td><td>

 

</td></tr><tr><td>

Advanced Work Assignment

 PRB1944387

</td><td>

The 'Create Segment On WorkItem Accept' business rule runs unnecessarily when a previous accepted work item exists

</td><td>

 

</td><td>

1.  Call the 'Offer work' API on an interaction.
2.  Accept the work item.
3.  Clear out the assigned\_to on the interaction.
4.  Call the offer work API on the same interaction.

 Expected behavior: The 'Create Segment On WorkItem Accept' business rule shouldn't be triggered for the old work item.

 Actual behavior: The 'Create Segment On WorkItem Accept' business rule is triggered for the old work item.

AI Search UX

 PRB1941065

</td><td>

Response loads even after a 15 second timeout on the portal

</td><td>

The portal stops the loading sign, which means it's reached the 15 second timeout. The response to the user's query loads after that.

</td><td>

1.  Navigate to a portal with DW enabled.
2.  Search for any query, such as 'How to create a new user?'.

 Expected behavior: Once the portal times out, it doesn't load the response.

 Actual behavior: The portal stops the loading sign, which means it's reached the 15 second timeout, but the response loads after that.

Memory leak of JSON serializer in multivis API

</td><td>

Each time a data request is processed, a new serializer is created and not released unless a GC is performed, which causes a memory leak.

</td><td>

1.  Create a dashboard.
2.  Add a tab and add 50 identical single score vis:
    1.  Source: incident.
    2.  Condition: sys\_id is empty.
3.  Duplicate the tab 9 times so there are 500 visualizations in total.
4.  Disable the property 'com.snc.dashboard.streaming.enabled'.
5.  Stop the instance and start again, but don't access the instance in the browser.
6.  Use VisualVM to capture the heapdump.
7.  Search for 'IntegerDateSerializer' in the object list.

Observe that there are 0 results.

8.  Access the dashboard created in step 1.
9.  Go over all 10 tabs.
10. Use VisualVM to capture the heapdump.
11. Search for 'IntegerDateSerializer'.

Observe that there are ~500 results.

12. Repeat steps 8 through 11 \(get the heapdump and search\).

 Observe that there are ~1000 results. Each time a data request is processed, a new serializer is created and not released unless a GC is performed, which causes a memory leak.

Automated Test Framework \(ATF\)

 PRB1922654

</td><td>

Automated Test Framework **test** UI action fails due to a timeout error

</td><td>

There appears to be a race condition introduced in Yokohama. Tests that previously passed in Xanadu are now failing some of time when waiting for a response from the intent channel.

</td><td>

1.  Navigate to **Automated Test Framework \(ATF\)** &gt; **Tests**.
2.  Create a test.
3.  Add test step by opening an existing record with values:
    -   Form UI= SOW Workspace

    -   Record= Select any record
4.  Add test step by:
    1.  Select a UI action or UI action visibility.
    2.  Select **Save** for the UI action.
5.  Clear the instance cache and browser cache.
6.  Using an incognito browser session.
7.  Log in.
8.  Navigate to the test.

Customer Operations for Customer Service Management

 PRB1918447

</td><td>

The responsibility framework allows the selection of dot-walked fields in the UI, but in the backend it's not granting the access

</td><td>

The previous implementation used relationshipGR.isValidField\(\) for validating dot-walked field paths, but this method only validates if a field exists directly on a table and doesn't properly traverse dot-walked paths. In the responsibility framework UI, it is possible to select dot-walked fields, but the backend wasn't properly validating these paths, resulting in access being denied for records even when the configuration should allow it.

Database Persistence - Data Access

 PRB1923704

</td><td>

Due to an ordering change on Raptor post migration, certificate authentications for API calls may fail and cause '500' errors

</td><td>

When mutual authentication is configured using both protocol profile and system properties, the system property takes precedence. This causes the SSL exchange to utilize the socket factory for client certificate provisioning, bypassing the keystore defined in the protocol profile. Additionally, when mutual authentication is enabled via property configuration, all certificates from the sys\_certificate table are loaded. This can lead to intermittent outbound call failures if expired certificates are cached and used for mutual authentication, resulting in HTTP 500 responses.

Order tables in the view deterministically

</td><td>

Currently, when constructing the view to return from a cypher call, it creates the view from the set of the tables being requested based on enumerating the keyset. This has a nondeterministic order that depends on the underlying structure and the table prefixes. While that wouldn't be an issue at some layers, it means the ACL evaluation differs based on the ordering, which is hard for debugging and also hard to configure around. Instead, it should sort the order of the tables in the view alphabetically by the table name.

</td><td>

1.  Do a cypher query with more than one return node.
2.  Examine the view definition to see which table comes first.

Database Persistence - WDF

 PRB1938101

</td><td>

The 'Database' view for Workflow Data Fabric \(WDF\) incorrectly assumes the sys\_id when caching underlying glide records

</td><td>

add/getCache in the 'Database' view has a hardcoded assumption that there's a sys\_id element in the source and doesn't check for a null result. The copyValue code calls into GlideElement, which short circuits due to the WDF table being a foreign table. This needs to skip the cross scope check but still copy the value.

MID Server

 PRB1923497

</td><td>

Deadlock occurred due to two threads

</td><td>

The issue is caused by a conflict between two internal processes that manage and refresh OAuth credentials and MID Server connections. The platform periodically checks and refreshes expired OAuth tokens using a scheduled job. When this happens, the system reloads the credentials and resets all related connection data to ensure security and consistency. At the same time, if a Discovery probe or integration is trying to establish a new connection, it might attempt to access the same shared connection resources. This overlap can lead to both processes waiting for each other to finish, resulting in a temporary deadlock where neither process can proceed.

High frequency one\_extend\_rate\_ limit\_violation\_cache flushes, causing system slowness

During routine operations, multiple nodes experienced high memory usage and glide.cs.worker thread pressure, resulting in frequent node restarts. Investigation indicates that the one\_extend\_rate\_limit\_violation\_cache flush events were triggered at an unusually high frequency \(over 5000 times within a 30-minute window\), which may have contributed to the observed slowness. Analysis suggests that excessive cache flushes can create significant memory and performance pressure on the system.

</td><td>

1.  Run a capability.
2.  Navigate to the sys\_generative\_ai\_log table.
3.  Check the **prompt** fields.

 Expected behavior: Users shouldn't see extra escaped characters in the prompt.

 Actual behavior: Valid escaped sequences are escaped unnecessarily.

Transaction Management

 PRB1947766

</td><td>

When a new token is refreshed with OAuth, the transaction.fUser property is set to 'guest' even if the GlideSession is authenticated with the correct user, which breaks the integration usage GuestUserFilter

</td><td>

With OAuth 2.0, when the first integration request is sent, it refreshes the expired token. After the transaction is complete and the notifyTransactionComplete monitor list is executed, there is a discrepancy between the **Transaction.fUser** field and the GlideSession.get\(\) .getUserName\(\) value. This occurs for a fully authenticated session. When checking if the user is a guest, Transaction.getUser\(\) isn't accurate. The check in GuestUserFilter only looks at the transaction object, when it needs to look at the GlideSession object.

</td><td>

1.  Create a regular user, and don't select webserviceaccessonly.
2.  Setup OAuth 2.0 locally.
3.  Trigger a request against the table API by authenticating with OAuth as that user.
4.  Wait until the OAuth token expires, which is approximately 30 mins.
5.  Put a break point on Transaction.notify TransactionComplete\(\).
6.  Trigger another request.
