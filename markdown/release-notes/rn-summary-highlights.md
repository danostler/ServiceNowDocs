    -   Existing customers who are upgrading \(starting with Zurich Patch 4\): Any previously unconfigured skill, agent, or agentic workflow is turned on automatically \(the AI asset was never configured and turned on, then turned off again\). Previously configured skills and agentic workflows that were turned on, then off, remain inactive.

Authentication

</td><td>

[Zurich Patch 10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/release-notes/zurich-patch-10.md)

-   **[Knowledge-based factor enhancement for AI voice service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/platform-security/authentication/knowledge-based-authentication.md)**

Following are the knowledge-based authentication \(KBA\) enhancements:

    -   Email OTP as an authentication factor for AI voice service: Use Email OTP as a standalone factor, a primary factor, or a secondary factor in AI voice agent authentication flows. When a caller reaches the voice agent, a one-time password is sent to their registered email address. The caller provides the password to complete authentication.
    -   KBA for AI voice service: Use the KBA setup to configure Knowledge-Based Authentication \(KBA\) for the voice channel. Choose from base system questions at both the identification level and the authentication level. AI voice service mappings are populated automatically from your Assistant Designer selection, so manually mapping voice services is no longer a mandatory step in the KBA setup.
    -   Authenticate callers at the start of every call: Prompt callers for authentication or identification details at the start of every call, before the voice-only assistant responds to any request, using the Authenticate at the start of the call option on the Assistant Designer's Caller verification page.

[Zurich Patch 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/release-notes/zurich-patch-4.md)

-   **[Authentication factors for AI voice service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/platform-security/authentication/authentication-factors.md)**

Enable caller access to AI voice agents by configuring the required identification and authentication factors.

-   **[OAuth enhancements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/platform-security/authentication/api-inbound-and-outbound.md)**

Following are the OAuth enhancements:

    -   Use **Opaque** or **JWT** token option for your inbound integration endpoints.
    -   Use the **Allow access only to APIs in selected scope** option to enable access to the APIs that are explicitly listed in the selected scopes for your inbound integrations.
    -   Use the OAuth Entity Resource tab for outbound integrations to configure resource parameters so they flow into the OAuth token request and are reflected in the token from your OAuth provider.

[Zurich Patch 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/release-notes/zurich-patch-1.md)

-   **[Provider name for Inbound integrations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/platform-security/authentication/new-inbound-integrations.md)**

Use the Provider name field to enter the details of your inbound integrations to distinguish between different inbound integrations on your ServiceNow AI Platform®. Update the Provider name in your API integrations to improve monitoring capabilities:

    -   For OAuth integrations, update the provider name using the Provider name field. To know more, see [OAuth inbound](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/platform-security/authentication/oauth-inbound.md).
    -   For Basic authentication integrations, update the Provider name in the integration registration form. To know more about the integration registration form, see [View Inbound API Integration Usage dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/api-reference/web-services/view-inbound-api-integration-usage-dashboard.md).

[Zurich Patch 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/release-notes/zurich-patch-1.md)
