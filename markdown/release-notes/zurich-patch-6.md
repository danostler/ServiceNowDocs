CMDB Query Builder

</td><td>

Calls to QueryBuilder from ServiceMapping return no results when executing in the new V2 mode

</td><td>

In Zurich, processes that call into Query Builder can have no results returned. There are two scenarios where this occurs. Firstly, a service CI populated via CMDB Group containing a saved query \(as constructed in Query Builder\) can have no 'svc\_ci\_assoc' records, even when rerunning the service population. However, the expected CIs will appear when viewing the CMDB Group or the saved query directly. Secondly, instances configured to use 'Zing' for Global Search don't return any CI records in the findings. These different methods both rely on the 'CMDBGroup' API, which may not return results of query execution when using the 'v2' execution mode introduced in Zurich. Instances are at risk if they use dynamic CI groups which are built using Query Builder, they're on an impacted Zurich Version, and the system property glide.cmdb. query.execution \_mode = 'v2'.

In the current UI16 email client, users can add attachments using the paper-clip icon or by dragging and dropping files into the email body. However, drag-and-drop doesn't work outside the email body because a background field was not properly defined, which causes this limitation.

1.  Log in to a Zurich instance.
2.  Navigate to the incident.list.
3.  Open Email Client.
4.  Drag and drop an attachment.

Access Control

 PRB1966968

</td><td>

ScriptingGovernanceUtils does not correctly create sys\_user\_has\_role records for the snc\_required \_script\_writer \_permission based on the legacy/V1 or V2 Role Management mechanisms

</td><td>

In Zurich, a 'Conditional Script Writer' group has been introduced and this group has the single role 'snc\_required \_script\_writer \_permission'. Users are added to this group automatically by a scheduled job during the Zurich upgrade. This is done by inserting records into sys\_user\_grmember and sys\_user\_has\_role to create this relationship. The ServiceNow platform has two currently different ways of tracking the roles in the sys\_user\_has\_role table: Legacy/V1 Role Management and Role Management V2. V2 introduced the concept of inheritance counts with the goal of reducing the overall size and complexity of the sys\_user\_has\_role table, with the benefit of reducing the amount of time performing large roles changes could take. With the legacy mechanism the three fields **granted\_by**, **included\_in\_role** and **included\_in\_role** instance record where a role was inherited from and need to be correctly set. If a user is a member of the 'Conditional Script Writer' group, and therefore they inherit the 'snc\_required\_script\_writer\_permission' role, then the sys\_user\_has\_role record must have the **granted\_by** field set to the sys\_id of the 'Conditional Script Writer' group. Without this, the 'Group Member Delete' business rule on sys\_user\_grmember is unable to delete the sys\_user\_has\_role record if the user is removed from the group.

Activity Stream

 PRB1973866

When showEmailMiniCompose = ON\_EMAIL\_ACTION, users can't reply to an email more than once

</td><td>

 

</td><td>

1.  Select the **ALL** menu.
2.  Type 'sys\_aw\_master\_config.list'.
3.  Open the 'Agent Workspace' row.
4.  Check the 'Active' checkbox.
5.  In the browser URL bar, type '/workspace' after the instance URL.
6.  On the record page, use the declarative action to compose a new email and send it.
7.  On the instance, navigate to 'sys\_email.list' and find the email just sent to switch the status to 'Sent'.
8.  On the record page, select **Reply** on the activity stream tile for the email sent.
9.  An email tab appears in 'compose'; fill it out and send it.

Once it is sent, the 'Email' tab disappears.

10. Select reply on the same email tile as before.
11. The email tab should appear again; fill out the email and select **Send**.

 Expected behavior: Users should be able to send another reply if they already sent the previous one. If they have not sent it, then selecting the **Reply** in the tile doesn't do anything.

 Actual behavior: When selecting **Reply**, it is loading the previously sent reply draft. Selecting **Send** gets a error saying that the draft was previously sent.

When the SLO \(single logout\) URL field is left empty in the IdP configuration, the system redirects to external\_logout\_complete with an error code slo\_error. However, this behavior is incorrect.

In the Gemini BYOK integration, outbound requests made by NAP and AI Agents fail because the generated outbound URLs don't include the project ID from the connection URL \(sys\_alias\).

As a results, calls are sent to an incorrect or incomplete Gemini endpoint, and the user gets the error 'Invalid HTTP response 404: Not Found'. In contrast, Incident Summarization and Code Generation features work correctly because they use the Flow Designer, which properly constructs outbound URLs and includes the project ID as part of the request path. Since NAP and AI Agents bypass Flow Designer and instead use the Java proxy which omits the project ID, their outbound calls fail consistently.

Duplicate records are created in the analytics\_category\_m2m table when using UnloadDashboard before and after Platform Analytics migration

</td><td>

In the Zurich release, when a Core UI dashboard is exported from a source instance using UnloadDashboard before a Platform Analytics migration, and then the same dashboard is migrated to a Platform Analytics dashboard and exported again using UnloadDashboard after migration, duplicate category records are created in the analytics\_category\_m2m table upon importing to the target instance. This issue occurs when both the source and target instances perform the migration process and the migrated dashboard is re-imported through an update set. As a result, the migrated dashboard in the target instance displays two identical categories, with duplicate links in the analytics\_category\_m2m table.

</td><td>

1.  In the source instance, create a new update set and set it as current.
2.  Create a Core UI dashboard and assign it to a dashboard group.
3.  Use the UnloadDashboard functionality to record the dashboard into the current update set.
4.  Mark the update set as 'Complete' and export it to an XML file.
5.  In the target instance, upload, preview, and commit the update set XML file.
6.  In both the source and target instances, migrate the Core UI dashboard to a Platform Analytics dashboard using Migration Center.
7.  In the source instance, create an update set and set it as current again.
8.  Use UnloadDashboard again \(this time after the Platform Analytics migration\) to capture the Platform Analytics dashboard into the update set.
9.  In the target instance, upload, preview, and commit this new update set XML file.
10. In the target instance, open the migrated Platform Analytics dashboard and verify its category.

If a document has modified content controls with track changes turned on, document generation fails when Sync Document is performed

Work Order Management

When the task's location and agent doesn't have a timezone, the system timezone should be used

</td><td>

This would keep the Dispatcher Workspace behavior in sync with platform behavior. All places across the platform use the system timezone whenever there is no explicit timezone specified on the location record or agent record.

</td><td>

1.  Make sure the dispatcher is in the US/Eastern timezone.
2.  Make sure the system is in the US/Pacific timezone.
3.  As the dispatcher, view agents and tasks on DWS.

 Observe that the US/Eastern timezone is seen if the agent/task doesn't have a timezone. If the user opens that record on workspace or platform view, the default timezone is shown as US/Pacific, honoring the system timezone.

3.  Navigate to vtb\_board.list.
4.  Open any dashboard having a condition with a date-time filter.
5.  Select **Show board** under related links.

 Expected behavior: The VTB board should load and the session should remain with the roles the user is entitled for that session.

 Actual behavior: Users observed a security constraints access 403 error for any subsequent action.

Zing Text Indexing and Search Engine

 PRB1972145

</td><td>

The query is slow from the TS Index Stats job from the getTableList method

</td><td>

The 'TS Index Stats' job executes some code to get a list of extension tables to index for a given base table. To do this, it executes an expensive aggregate query against the base table, grouping by the **sys\_class\_name** field. This doesn't scale well and can cause queries to run long, which impacts overall database and instance performance.

</td><td>

1.  Navigate to a large CMDB or SYS\_IMPORT\_SET\_ROW table.
2.  Run the TS Index Stats job.

 Expected behavior: The job runs quickly.

 Actual behavior: The job runs slowly as these extended tables grow in size.
