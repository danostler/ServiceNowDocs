</td></tr><tr><td>

Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\)

</td><td>

Due to the removal of the **Design** value for the operational status attribute in a CI, after an upgrade, you must review all CIs that have the discovery source attribute set to **Manual via IRE**. Review the operational status attribute of those CIs and set it to a supported value in CMDB for your environment. For example, you can set the attribute to **Non-Operational**. For more information about the operational status values, see .

On an upgraded Zurich instance, to configure the sn\_cmdb\_admin and the sn\_cmdb\_editor user roles with the necessary permissions to perform some CMDB Workspace tasks, you must manually run the scheduled job **Remove CMDB Roles from ITIL roles and Add CUD access to sn\_cmdb\_admin/sn\_cmdb\_editor roles**. This scheduled job modifies the user roles as follows:

-   Updates the itil user role to no longer contain the sn\_cmdb\_editor user role, and updates the itil\_admin user role to no longer contain the sn\_cmdb\_admin user role.
-   If those permissions don't exist, updates the sn\_cmdb\_admin and the sn\_cmdb\_editor user roles with create, update, and delete access to the Configuration Item \[cmdb\_ci\] class. For more information about the **Remove CMDB Roles from ITIL roles and Add CUD access to sn\_cmdb\_admin/sn\_cmdb\_editor roles** scheduled job, see [Remove sn\_cmdb\_admin from itil\_admin and sn\_cmdb\_editor from itil, and then add create/update/delete access to cmdb\_ci table for sn\_cmdb\_admin / sn\_cmdb\_editor \[KB2290506\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB2290506).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Container Vulnerability Response

</td><td>

If you are currently using Container Vulnerability Response, and you do not intend to upgrade to Unified Security Exposure Management \(USEM\), install a version below v30.x of Container Vulnerability Response and for upgrades to supported third-party integration applications.

The Missing Assets \[sn\_vul\_wiz\_missing\_asset\] table used for storing assets imported by the backfill integrations for the Vulnerability Response Integration with Wiz is deprecated. If you are currently using the Vulnerability Response with Wiz integrations, after updating to version 1.1, you must backdate any of your existing Wiz primary integrations by three days and run them. Please review more information about the Wiz integration at [SecOps articles on the Security Operations Community](https://www.servicenow.com/community/secops-articles/announcement-wiz-integration-with-servicenow-secops/ta-p/3325055).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Encryption

</td><td>

For the GlideEncrypter API, NIST 800-131A Rev 2 has recommended against using the Triple Data Encryption Standard \(3DES\) encryption. The following changes are taking place in the Zurich release with the official removal of 3DES encryption for GlideEncrypter.

-   The GlideEncrypter API defaults to using the Key Management Framework \(KMF\) based algorithm, Advanced Encryption Standard \(AES\), for encryption and decryption operations for upgraded instances only.
-   For instances created with the Zurich release or later, this API isn’t supported.
-   Learn more about 3DES deprecation in [KB1704481](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1704481).

In the Zurich release, Column Level Encryption has received a required upgrade to Key Management Framework Column Level Encryption \(KMF-CLE\) due to the platform-wide deprecation of 3DES. For more information about this upgrade, see KB1700704.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Encryption Key Management

</td><td>

-   In previous releases, the GlideEncrypter API used the three-key Triple Data Encryption Standard \(3DES\) encryption standard, which [NIST 800-131A Rev 2](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-131Ar2.pdf) has recommended against using after 2023. The following changes are taking place in the Zurich release in preparation for a full deprecation of GlideEncrypter/3DES in the future:
    -   New Zurich instances can’t use GlideEncrypter. All base system scripts have been changed to use alternative encryption processes.
    -   if you’re upgrading your Zurich instances, you can still GlideEncrypter, which has been updated to use AES256-GCM encryption via the Key Management Framework.
    -   Learn more about 3DES deprecation in [KB1704481](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1704481).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Enterprise Asset Management

</td><td>

Starting with Zurich release, a new menu, Asset put away, has been added to the ServiceNow Agent app navigation bar. When upgrading to the Zurich release, a fix script identifies whether the ServiceNow Agent app navigation bar was customized and takes the necessary action.

-   If the navigation bar wasn’t customized before the upgrade, a new Asset put away icon \(\[Omitted image "asset-putaway-icon-ma.png"\] Alt text: Asset put away icon\) is included in the navigation bar
-   If the navigation bar was customized before the upgrade, two navigation bars appear: Customized old IT Asset Management and IT Asset Management. The new icon appears in the IT Asset Management navigation bar.

</td></tr><tr><td>

External Content Connectors

</td><td>

Beginning with version 2 of the External Content Connectors application, external content connectors implement semantic vector indexing for crawled items. When you upgrade to a version that supports semantic vector indexing, your existing connectors will reindex all previously retrieved items the next time they're visited by a crawl, even if those items' content is unchanged. To force semantic vector indexing of your external content items as soon as possible after upgrading, cancel any running crawls, then restart the canceled crawls manually.

When you upgrade to version 4 of the External Content Connectors application from an earlier version, searches may not show all previously crawled content until you've completed both a content crawl and a user mapping crawl for each upgraded connector. The first content crawl run after the upgrade will reindex all searchable content from the source system, and the user mapping crawl will reindex all security principals from the source system. All crawled content should be shown in searches after both of these crawls are complete.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Field Service Management

</td><td>

Effective March 1, 2025, the Google Places API, Directions API, and Distance Matrix API have been designated as legacy services. The newer versions of these services are Places API \(New\) and Routes API. Google Maps APIs for Field Service capabilities uses the latest version of the APIs in the Zurich release and Dispatcher Workspace version 8.0. To help avoid issues with the Google Maps APIs, enable Places API \(New\) and Routes API from Google Cloud Platform Console.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Flows, subflows, and actions in Workflow Studio

</td><td>

An earlier version of the save as you go feature was released and withdrawn from the Washington DC release. If you're upgrading from the Washington DC release, you might have manually turned off the save as you go features by setting a system property. To restore the save as you go features, see .

</td></tr><tr><td>

Generative AI Controller

</td><td>

Generative AI Controller is installed or updated when you install or update a Now Assist application. If you have issues installing or updating applications, see this [knowledge article](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1637452) or open a support case.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Hardware Asset Management

</td><td>

-   Starting from the Zurich release, a few workflows have been migrated to Workflow Studio as flows.

**Note:** The migration of workflows to Workflow Studio applies to Asset Management, Procurement, and Contract Management applications.

    -   The following workflows have been migrated to Workflow Studio as flows:
        -   Procurement Process Flow – Hardware
        -   Transfer Order
        -   Transfer Order Line
        -   Source Request
        -   Contract Approval
    -   When upgrading to the Zurich release, a fix script identifies whether the workflows were customized and takes necessary action.
        -   If the workflows weren’t customized before the upgrade, the legacy workflows are deactivated from the instance, and Workflow Studio flows are installed and executed post-upgrade.
        -   If the impacted workflows were customized before the upgrade, the Workflow Studio flows are installed but aren’t executed for any of the impacted flows post-upgrade. You can view and access the impacted workflows in the instance after the upgrade. However, the deprecated workflows are considered custom code and aren’t supported for maintenance.
-   After upgrading to the Zurich release, if an approval history record exists for a contract that is no longer required, reject the record instead of deleting it. If the approval history record is deleted, Workflow Studio doesn’t support updating the contract’s **Substate** field value to display the correct state.
-   Starting with Zurich release, a new menu, Asset put away, has been added to the ServiceNow Agent app navigation bar. When upgrading to the Zurich release, a fix script identifies whether the ServiceNow Agent app navigation bar was customized and takes the necessary action.
    -   If the navigation bar wasn’t customized before the upgrade, a new Asset put away icon \(\[Omitted image "asset-putaway-icon-ma.png"\] Alt text: Asset put away icon\) is included in the navigation bar
    -   If the navigation bar was customized before the upgrade, two navigation bars appear: Customized old IT Asset Management and IT Asset Management. The new icon appears in the IT Asset Management navigation bar.
-   A new role, sn\_itam\_recomm.recommendations\_read, helps ensure that only valid users can execute APIs related to the Important Actions menu in the Asset Workspace. The following roles, which have access to the Asset Workspace, now include the sn\_itam\_recomm.recommendations\_read role:
    -   procurement\_user
    -   inventory\_admin
    -   inventory\_user
    -   model\_manager
    -   contract\_manager
    -   itil
    -   catalog\_manager
    -   catalog\_admin
    -   sam
    -   ham\_user
    -   asset
-   Control sensitive data leakage from range queries accessed by unauthenticated users through the following access control lists \(ACLs\):
    -   Contract \[ast\_contract\] table: Only users with the contract\_manager role can perform the query\_range operation on the Start date, Contract number, PO number, and Vendor columns.
    -   Contract user M2M \[clm\_m2m\_contract\_user\] table: Only users with the contract\_manager and asset roles can perform the query\_range operation on the Contract and User columns.
    -   HAMP Success Activity \[sn\_hamp\_success\_activity\] table: Only users with the ham\_admin and asset roles can perform the query\_range operation on the Description, Short description, and Success goals columns.
-   Only users with the admin role can update the following system properties:
    -   glide.sg.voice\_search.enabled
    -   glide.ui.sn\_hamp\_asset\_reclaim\_task\_activity.fields
    -   glide.ui.sn\_hamp\_loaner\_asset\_order\_activity.fields
    -   glide.ui.sn\_hamp\_ztr\_task\_activity.fields
    -   sn\_hamp.enable\_shipping\_carrier\_validation\_asn
    -   sn\_hamp.model\_lifecycle\_phase\_order
    -   sn\_hamp.update\_assets\_norm\_model\_name

The Impact Store Application configuration requires a sequence of tasks in a unified registration process. See .

</td></tr><tr><td>

Instance Data Replication

</td><td>

-   Improve the performance and processing efficiency of Instance Data Replication \(IDR\) by upgrading your replication sets to V2, which uses Hermes Messaging Service. For details, see .
-   Log rotation is automatically enabled for the Replication Payload Error \[idr\_replication\_payload\_error\] table after the upgrade. By default, the log rotation schedule is composed of seven shards, with five days for each shard. All log entries in this table created before the upgrade are automatically truncated.

</td></tr><tr><td>

MID Server

</td><td>

For the latest MID Server system requirements, see MID Server system requirements. The minimum JRE version supported is 17.0.10 and the recommended version is 17.0.12.

If you have installed your own JRE, the upgrade process takes the following actions to verify that the MID Server uses a supported JRE:

-   If a MID Server is using an unsupported version of the JRE when it upgrades, the upgrade process displays a warning message with the minimum and recommended JRE version.
-   If a supported JRE is running on the MID Server host, the upgraded MID Server uses that version.

All MID Server host machines require access to the download site at `install.service-now.com` to enable auto-upgrades. For additional details, read how the system manages MID Server upgrades.

Only one Windows MID Server service is permitted according to the executable path. Upgraded Windows MID Servers that have multiple services pointing to the same installation folder can’t start. See MID Server fails to start for more information.

For more information about MID Server upgrades, see the following topics:

-   MID Server pre-upgrade check: Describes how the AutoUpgrade monitor tests the ability of the MID Server to upgrade on your system before the actual upgrade.
-   Upgrade the MID Server manually: Describes how to upgrade your MID Servers manually.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Notify

</td><td>

Starting with the Zurich release, Notify uses subflows instead of workflows. For existing users in Zurich, your current workflows are still supported. For new users, your Notify plugin installations use subflows.

As part of this transition, the following workflow activities are available as flow actions and can be used when creating subflows:

-   Join conference call
-   Call
-   Send SMS
-   Forward call
-   Input
-   Hangup
-   Play
-   Record
-   Reject
-   Say
-   Forward to notify client
-   Queue

Maintain, build, and modify your own custom subflows in Workflow Studio with subflows for new instances. The following base system workflows have been migrated to subflows:

-   \(Re\)join Conference Call
-   Join Conference Call with muting
-   Join Conference Call with SMS

Your existing workflows continue to function after the upgrade.

**Note:** All workflow-related artifacts have been moved to a new plugin, which is maintained in a support-only mode and isn't available for new installations.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Now Assist

</td><td>

Customers who have not opted into third-party, large language models may be routed to them during skill execution. If the new model is not provisioned or available in your environment, this will result in skill execution failures. Check the models your skills use within Now Assist admin console.

If you customized UI actions or other items that are associated with Now Assist skills, confirm that your customized code is updated with the new skill releases. Otherwise, certain functions might not work as expected.

If you run into issues when you're upgrading a Now Assist product, see the [Issues and mitigation for Now Assist \(Generative AI\) Applications and Plugin updates \[KB1637452\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1637452) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base. Log in to view the article.

The Zurich release introduces enhanced protections for read‑only fields across the ServiceNow® AI Platform. These changes include a new “read\_only\_option” field with granular control levels, including “strict\_read\_only” and “client\_script\_modifiable". The changes occur in the back-end and maintain backward‑compatible behavior. This update helps strengthen your instance security while preserving the flexibility you need. If you have custom client scripts that modify ServiceNow® ‑owned read‑only fields using `g_form.setValue()` or `g_form.clearValue()`, refer to [KB2718122](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2718122). This article provides additional technical details on how to identify affected fields and adjust their settings.

The existing Access Control Lists \(ACLs\) will be updated to replace the 'admin' role with specific, purpose-driven granular roles within scripts or security attributes. As part of this update, the `getRoles()` API will be replaced with the `hasRole()` API for authorization purposes. Additionally, all references to the 'admin' role in the code will be substituted with the new feature-specific granular roles for authorization use cases. Read [https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/platform-security/granular-admin-roles.html](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/platform-security/granular-admin-roles.html) to learn more.

Product Catalog Management and Pricing Management

</td><td>

Pricing Management v15.0.0 provides a default pricing plan that includes new steps to support pricing strategies introduced in this release. If you're using a custom pricing plan from an earlier release, review the default pricing plan, which is in a Retired state after you upgrade. Determine whether you want to publish the default plan or customize the default pricing plan for your needs. The default plan contains new steps for calculating net pricing and roll-up values for configurable products in quotes and orders: Net Price Calculation, Line Rollup, and Header Rollup steps. This pricing functionality existed in previous releases for quotes and orders but wasn’t included in the default pricing plan. To retain this previous functionality for quotes and orders, you must add the Net Price Calculation, Line Rollup, and Header Rollup steps in your custom pricing plan before you publish it for use.

If you used the legacy product configurator previously and want to use the CPQ Configurator, after upgrading set the **sn\_prd\_pm.enable\_advanced\_configuration** system property to true. When set to true, this property enables the CPQ Configurator.

If you want to use AI Search for product catalog searches, before upgrading install Now Assist for Sales Force Automation \(SFA\), which includes the plugins needed for AI Search functionality. After upgrading, complete various steps to implement AI Search. These steps include running a scheduled job to set up AI Search and enabling AI Search in the product catalog interface by setting the **enable\_ai\_search\_in\_catalog** system property to true. For details on these configuration steps, see Configuring AI Search for product catalog search.

RPA Hub

</td><td>

Upgrade any of these currently installed Microsoft Software Installers \(MSIs\) by downloading the RPA applications:

-   RPA Desktop Design Studio
-   Attended Robot
-   Unattended Robot
-   Unattended Robot Login Agent

For more information, see Download the RPA applications from RPA Hub.

The following upgrade information is applicable only when you’re upgrading from San Diego or Tokyo to Zurich.

Based on the number of records in the application file table, you may experience a delay while upgrading the RPA Hub applications from Tokyo or earlier releases to Zurich.

Before upgrading RPA Hub to Zurich, you must set the value of the **glide.rollback.blacklist.TableParentChange.change** system property to **false**. If this property doesn't exist in the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table, add the property and set its value to false. For more information on how to add a property, see .

After you upgrade to Zurich, the bot process definitions change to the new structure, which is the bot process configuration.

Although the bot process configuration doesn't replace the bot process completely, most fields are moved from the bot process to the bot process configuration. If you upgrade to Zurich without updating the system property value, the tables don’t extend the Application File \[sys\_metadata\] table. To update the table changes manually, see the [Restructuring RPA Hub tables to sys\_metadata in Utah and beyond release \[KB1223629\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1223629) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Retail applications

</td><td>

Starting with this release onwards, the retail base case has been made abstract. \(An abstract case or abstract case type is a base configuration of a case that is intended to be extended by specialized case types rather than used directly.\) After upgrading to the Zurich release and for any version updates beginning with the Yokohama release, if you are using the retail base case table you will no longer be able to create new cases or update existing cases. Use the following case types instead:

-   Store Inquiry
-   Retail Customer Complaint
-   In-store Operations
-   HQ Communications

You can also extend your own case types. For more information on these changes, see the [Impact analysis and guidance: Retail case table updates \[KB2216547\]](https://support.servicenow.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fkb_knowledge.do%3Fsys_id%3Da312916e978aa650f03d739c1253af88%26sysparm_view%3D%26sysparm_domain%3Dnull%26sysparm_domain_scope%3Dnull) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Service Exchange

</td><td>

-   Service Exchange version 2.x.x: Which was first released with the Xanadu release, doesn’t support migration of Service Exchange \(Legacy\) versions.

Service Exchange \(Legacy\) version: Before you upgrade to the Zurich release, follow instructions in the [Service Bridge for Providers \(Legacy\) - Migration Utility \[KB1499823\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1499823) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base to migrate your configuration data.

-   Service Exchange version 2.x.x: Due to the introduction of mismatched version support, new entitlements can’t be activated until both the consumers and providers upgrade to Service Exchange version 2.x.x. Older active entitlements continue to work but new ones can’t be activated.
-   When you upgrade to Service Exchange version 2.0.55 with Sales Customer Relationship Management plug-in version 1.0.4, before upgrading the platform to the Zurich release, new Deny ACLs aren't installed. To ensure the Deny ACLs get installed, after upgrading to Zurich, select Repair to reinstall the Service Exchange application.
-   When using Service Exchange for Providers and Service Exchange for Consumers in a single instance, you must upgrade both applications simultaneously to the same version to maintain compatibility.
-   When you install the Service Exchange application, the Service Exchange Global Script Include is automatically installed or updated on the following platform versions:
    -   Washington DC patch 9
    -   Xanadu patch 4
    -   Yokohama

Software Asset Management

</td><td>

Starting from the Zurich release, the following workflows are migrated to Flow Designer as flows:

-   Reclamation workflow
-   Procurement Process Flow - Auto allocation enabled

When upgrading to the Zurich release, a fix script identifies whether the workflows were customized. If you haven't customized the workflows before the upgrade, the fix script deactivates the legacy workflows from the instance and deploys the Flow Designer flows on the instance post-upgrade. If you have customized the impacted workflows in the previous release, the fix script doesn’t deploy the Flow Designer flows on the instance post-upgrade. You can view and access the impacted workflows in the instance after the upgrade. However, the deprecated workflows are considered as custom code and ServiceNow doesn’t support those workflows.

Starting from the Zurich release, the Software Asset Workspace plugin \(com.sn\_sam\_workspace\) is moved from the family release to the Software Asset Workspace store application. After upgrading to Zurich, the Software Asset Workspace plugin \(com.sn\_sam\_workspace\) is inactivated and the Software Asset Workspace store application \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) is enabled in the instance.

When upgrading to the Software Asset Management – SaaS License Management plugin \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) version 16.0.6 or later in the Zurich release, verify that the Software Asset Workspace store app \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) is updated to version 9.0.4.

**Important:** Due to a performance issue identified with the upgrade fix script, the sourcing fix script has been modified. This script will no longer execute automatically during the upgrade process. Instead, it is now delivered as an on-demand job. Administrators must manually execute this job outside of business hours after the upgrade is complete.

After upgrading to Strategic Planning v4.8.0, the existing **Investment type** and **Investment class** fields will appear as **Investment type \(Deprecated\)** and **Investment class \(Deprecated\)** respectively across the Planning page including in the Prioritization and Roadmap views and in the Scenario Planning page. The values from these deprecated fields will be automatically copied to the new **Investment type** and **Investment class** fields.

If you previously applied filters or personalized your view using the deprecated fields, you must update those configurations to use the new **Investment type** and **Investment class** fields across the workspace—including in the Prioritization and Roadmap views on the Planning page, as well as in the Scenario Planning page.

Third-party Risk Management

</td><td>

If you’re a VRM user upgrading to TPRM and upgrading to Vancouver or a later release from an earlier release, you must run each upgrade sequentially to ensure that fix scripts run correctly. For example, you must upgrade from Utah to Vancouver, Vancouver to Washington DC, and so on. If the scripts don’t run in the correct order, you can get data inconsistencies, broken functionalities, and conflicts.

After upgrading to version 21.0.x, you can enable the Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) by setting the Smart Assessment Engine enabled \(**sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.sae\_enabled**\) property. After setting this property, Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) becomes the default assessment engine and replaces the legacy experience. The transition isn’t reversible.

**Warning:**

Set this property in your non-production instances and conduct thorough testing before changing your production instances. Failure to do so may result in unexpected issues.

For more information on upgrading from VRM to TPRM and the differences between the Smart and Classic Assessment engines, see [Third-party Risk Management upgrade information](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/release-notes/grc-tprm-upgrade-info.md).

For existing TPRM customers, after upgrading to version 21.0.3, data from the Industry column in the Company \[core\_company\] table is automatically migrated to the tprm\_industry column. Migration can take several hours depending on the number of records in the Company \[core\_company\] table. After migration, a system log message confirms that the migration is complete. Review the Company \[core\_company\] table content and update any customizations referencing the Industry field to use tprm\_industry. After verifying the migration and updating customizations, you can drop the Industry column.

Vulnerability Response

</td><td>

If you're currently using Vulnerability Response, and you do not intend to upgrade to Unified Security Exposure Management \(USEM\), install a version below v30.x of Vulnerability Response and for upgrades to supported third-party integration applications.

The Missing Assets \[sn\_vul\_wiz\_missing\_asset\] table used for storing assets imported by the backfill integrations for the Vulnerability Response Integration with Wiz is deprecated. If you're currently using the Vulnerability Response with Wiz integrations, after updating to new version 1.1, you must backdate any of your existing Wiz primary integrations by three days and run them. Review more information about the Wiz integration at [SecOps articles on the Security Operations Community](https://www.servicenow.com/community/secops-articles/announcement-wiz-integration-with-servicenow-secops/ta-p/3325055).
