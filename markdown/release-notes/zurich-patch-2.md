Repeated errors messages 'The connection attempt failed' occur when the TXID is the same for hours. Connection creation requests can be unreasonably slow. When the PostgreSQL service is stopped in a lab, almost instant failures are experienced and it takes 13 seconds to exhaust all retries. In a production environment, when a DB host becomes unavailable due to hardware failure, it can take hours to exhaust all retries because each request takes ~100 seconds per request.

Offline-mode payload generation has excessive memory retention, causing performance degradation due to an SG offline document job

</td><td>

The Yokohama release introduced major changes to the way in which mobile offline payloads are generated, most notably embedded forms are now transformed into redirected forms. This removes the embedded forms from list screen documents and turns them into separate documents. With that change resulted in an increase in the number of documents that are processed during offline payload generation. This number can spike to as large as twice or three times as many documents processed compared to previous releases. As such, this results in an excessive number of GlideRecord instances being retained in memory. This has been seen to cause memory issues, node restarts, and severe performance degradation for users.
