</td><td>

There's slowness when loading forms with **TableChoice** fields related to the RecordFamilyResolver .archiveTableHas ACLTerms code path

</td><td>

Accessing any form with a **TableChoice** field where the instance has more than 250 archive tables can result in slowness due to RecordFamilyResolver .archiveTableHasACLTerms code path and a change to CACHE\_ARCHIVE\_TABLE \_HAS\_ACL\_TERMS in Xanadu.

Adding other roles to the 'Contains role' tab in the 'snc\_internal' role causes unexpected behavior

</td><td>

Newly created users don't receive the 'snc\_internal' role when logging in, or getting impersonated, for the first time.

</td><td>

1.  Provision an instance with 'sn\_dlir' installed.
2.  Add the 'sn\_dlir.secure\_file\_download' role to the 'Contains role' related list in the 'snc\_internal'.
3.  Create a new user.
4.  Impersonate or log in under the newly created user.

 Expected behavior: Roles can't be added to the 'Contains role' related list in the 'snc\_internal', or there's a business role or another check that informs the user when they are doing it.

 Actual behavior: A newly created user doesn't receive 'snc\_internal'. In node logs, users can observe: '\*\*\* WARNING\*\*\* RoleAccessHandler: User does not have the role...'

</td><td>

1.  Navigate to /now/cwf/agent/home.
2.  Impersonate a user.
3.  In the list, select **My cases** &gt; **New**.
4.  Select **Accept UI Action**.

</td><td>

The 'Email' tab in the Activity Stream in the CSM Configurable Workspace doesn't resize when the text is larger than the vertical limit

</td><td>

This issue is found in Yokohama, but works as expected in Xanadu.

</td><td>

1.  Navigate to a Yokohama instance as an admin user.
2.  Navigate to the **Activity Stream** &gt; **More** &gt; **Email**.
3.  Select **Return past vertical limit**.

 Expected behavior: The email text box auto-resizes vertically.

 Actual behavior: The email text box doesn't auto-resize.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Activity Stream

 PRB1830587

</td><td>

Activity Stream doesn't limit the size of journal fields

</td><td>

The maximum size of journal entry appears to be either 50Kb or 100Kb by default. UI16 has a 10MB limit on the total journal field size. Once this limit was reached it truncates every journal entry to 50K. The entry cap is 250 by default. The entry cap is 30 for attachments. The size cap + entry cap is what ensured no out of memory errors in UI16.

</td><td>

1.  Create a script that creates a 10MB work note. This can be a 100 character string that is appended to the work note 100,000 times in a loop.
2.  Add 2-3 of these to a single incident.
3.  Request the incident in Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\).

 Expected behavior: The incident should load with these massive strings.

 Actual behavior: Chrome and Edge crash as the browser runs out of memory.

 1.  Add 100 of the 10MB work notes from \#1.
2.  Request the incident.

 Expected behavior: The incident should load in SOW.

 Actual behavior: The Glide server crashes with an out of memory error.

Activity Stream

 PRB1858894

 [KB2027692](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB2027692)

</td><td>

Application Programming Interface \(API\), Now Platform, and GraphQL are slow due to the Table Cleaner being throttled causing heavy replication lag

</td><td>

API, Now Platform, and GraphQL calls are slow specifically because of the Table Cleaner on sys\_activity shards. ​Using Instant Alter added an index, and as a result, all records were replicated with the load causing replication lag. When replication lag is detected, Table Cleaners are throttled, which can exacerbate the amount of data that is being replicated and cause timeouts. Timeouts are caused by the Table Cleaner running synchronously in the Activity Stream load request.

</td><td>

Refer to the listed KB article for details.

Activity Stream

 PRB1860591

</td><td>

Work notes are presented as encrypted text within the 'Activity' section of the ServiceNow Workspace when the encryption configuration is active

</td><td>

There's column-level encryption enabled and configured for the **work\_notes** field. When a user with a target role specified in the sys\_platform\_ encryption\_configuration record is posting worknotes in workspace, they are unable to see unencrypted text. Instead, they're seeing encrypted text. When the same user posts worknotes in the native view, the text isn't encrypted.

Activity Stream

 PRB1870524

</td><td>

If user\_id is in the form of a sys\_id, then the user isn't displayed correctly in the activity stream

</td><td>

The sys\_created\_by can be a user\_id or a sys\_id or an email, so it guesses based on the format. If the user\_id is copying the sys\_id format, then this process doesn't work.

</td><td>

1.  Create a user with a user\_id in the format of a sys\_id.
2.  Give the user sufficient roles to view workspace.
3.  Impersonate the user created.
4.  Navigate to some record on workspace and add a comment or make a field change.

 Notice this user's user\_id is displayed instead of the display name.

Agent Chat

 PRB1862727

</td><td>

A 'Show audio' modal appears when an agent presence state is changed to 'Available' for Safari users

</td><td>

A user interaction is required on the page for the audio to work, especially in inactive tabs. This was enforced by a modal when the audioContext was detected to be suspended, which occurs when a new AudioContext is created in the page. Now, the modal appears for Safari whenever the presence changes in the inbox to 'Available' to avoid having users refresh the browser to see the modal.

</td><td>

1.  As an agent, navigate to the legacy workspace with the url /workspace/agent.
2.  As a requestor, start a chat.
3.  After an agent accepts the work item, as a requestor, start sending some messages.

 Expected behavior: When desktop and sound notifications are turned on, an agent should hear the sound for a new message and receive desktop notifications for the new message.

 Actual behavior: There's no sound or desktop notification.

Index events take a long time when there's a substantial amount of data in the sys\_translated table

</td><td>

When indexing the **Translated** field from the sys\_translated table, all the data for a particular table is cached at once. When there's a frequent update or insert to the sys\_translated table, the rebuild cache takes an average of 5 seconds to 8 seconds per event.

</td><td>

1.  Enable a language plugin.
2.  Index a record with a **Translated** field with a translation in the sys\_translated table \(e.g. sys\_ui\_list, title field\)
3.  Navigate to **cache\_inspect.do**.
4.  Observe that all data for the same table will be loaded into the private TS\_TRANSLATED\_MAP cache.

AI Search indexing 'Topic Path Translation' doesn't work for a non-system user preference language

</td><td>

Session users assigned as 'guest' with the sys\_user\_preference file 'name=user.language' and 'value=some\_non\_ user\_session\_language' have topic paths indexed in this language. The set language isn't effective, which is the cause of incorrect translations.

</td><td>

1.  Ensure sys\_language has two active languages, **en** for English and **de** for Deutsch.
2.  Create an entry in the sys\_user\_preference table with the following values:
    -   system = true
    -   user = empty with language as 'de'
3.  Create the catalog item with translations for topic and topic path.

 Expected behavior: AI Search should index, and be able to search with the 'en' topic value.

 Actual behavior: AI Search indexes content with Deutsch translations for documents with both English and Deutsch languages, and the search for English fails.

A race condition causes an incorrect deleteMultiple\(\) query to be generated on the v\_search\_genius\_result and sys\_variable\_value tables

</td><td>

When the AI Search Genius Result is requested and processed in a multi-threaded, high-concurrency environment, such as when multiple users simultaneously perform search functions on a portal or virtual assistant \(VA\), a thread safety issue arises. This issue may cause an incorrect deleteMultiple\(\) query to be generated, potentially leading to the deletion of excessive records from the sys\_variable\_value table.

The **Table** field for EVAM view configuration matching of a search record is always the parent table

</td><td>

With the new EVAM-lite implementation, there are 3 gaps in the logic for determining which view configuration to use for a given search result. 1. If a view configuration has a condition based on a field that isn't included in the list of table fields, that field won't be returned from AIS, and so the condition never matches. Even if the field is included on the 'Table Fields' list, if it's a field that only exists on a child table of the table the indexed source is based on, the field won't be returned from AIS and so the condition never matches. If the first view configuration for a particular table comes after the default/global view config, it is never used. Whereas, EVAM had a more nuanced selection process that would look for all view configuration that matched on the table before falling back to those for ancestor tables or the global/default table.

</td><td>

1.  Set the system property glide.search.evam .logger.enabled to true.
2.  Open the Service Portal and search for 'new hire'.
3.  Open the syslog.
4.  Filter on 'Created'.
5.  Notice there's a message that contains: '\[SEARCH EVAM\] SearchResultTemplateGenerator: Using View Config 633c3b5d53a 71010968a ddeeff7b1218 for Result with table sc\_cat\_item and sys\_id 6690750 f4f7b4200086 eeed18110c761'.

 Expected behavior: Service Portal's EVAM Def'n has a view configuration called 'Catalog Search Results - Order Guides', which has a condition of 'sys\_class\_name = sc\_cat\_item\_guide^EQ'. This is the view configuration that should be used, and the syslog entry should contain: '\[SEARCH EVAM\] SearchResultTemplateGenerator: Using View Config 44c37371 c32020108 25039b06 e40dd4b for Result with table sc\_cat\_item and sys\_id 6690750 f4f7b4200086 eeed18110c761'.

 Actual behavior: The incorrect view config is being used. 633c3b5 d53a71010968 addeeff7b1218 is the sys\_id of the view configuration called 'Catalog Search Results', which is the generic view configuration for catalog items, and doesn't have any conditions beyond table.

 PRB1838597

 [KB1743614](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB1743614)

</td><td>

Event Rule changes can cause event\_rule.update \_events to block system events processing, causing a performance issue in the instance

</td><td>

When Event Rules are inserted or updated, an 'event\_rule.update\_events' system event is fired in the default events queue to re-check any event records not yet covered by any previously existing event rule. The script action 'Update event rules for empty events/Update rules after deletion of ER' runs for the event, which processes batches of system events from the platform and other features. When an instance has a large number of em\_event records matching the new rule criteria, this causes a long running transaction. Events can take several minutes to process, blocking the 'Events process 0' job of the app node, delaying the processing of other important events that should be processed in near real time.

</td><td>

1.  Open an instance with Event Management installed.
2.  Insert, update, or delete an Event Rule in which there will be a considerable number of existing em\_event record that will match it.

The CurrentContext Tracker reset scope and meta stack are in the wrong order

</td><td>

CurrentContextTracker attempts to clean up meta stack and script contexts after a flow execution. Both are reloaded in reverse to how they initially appeared when the flow starts. This happens because the ArrayDeque collection removes elements from the stack. The array from the queue is in the expected order \(A, B, C, etc\). When the elements are added back, the ArrayDeque adds elements at the front of the queue, so iterating from first to last on the list and pushing will result in a reversed stack. So the queue contains \(C, B, A\) instead of \(A, B, C\).

After upgrading from the Xanadu to Yokohama release, process mining filter sets and scheduled tasks are deleted

</td><td>

During the upgrade from Xanadu to Yokohama, the process mining filter set conditions and scheduled tasks are being deleted. Due to a backend issue, the upgrade script execution unintentionally deletes saved filter sets and scheduled tasks of Process Mining Projects. This particularly affects configurations with 'transition filters' linked to scheduled tasks. Although no other user data was affected, this issue may disrupt functionality where the deleted filter sets or scheduled tasks were actively used.
