# ServiceNow Studio tutorial part 4: Conclusion and review

Thank you for completing this ServiceNow Studio tutorial. This topic reviews some of what you learned through the tutorial.

The initial phase of the tutorial focused on developing a minimum viable product \(MVP\) for a request-fulfill workflow. This was achieved using ServiceNow Studio, incorporating:

-   A custom data model to store request details.
-   A record producer to enable end-users to initiate requests efficiently from a service portal.
-   A custom fulfiller workspace designed for streamlined service delivery.
-   A flow built using Workflow Studio to structure the overall workflow and automate process execution.

This foundational setup allowed for quick deployment, ensuring core functionality was in place to facilitate request submission and fulfillment.

Following the MVP, the application was enhanced for usability and efficiency. Improvements included:

-   Decision table integration: A business decision was encapsulated in a decision table, separating logic from the core business process. This enabled more flexible, rule-driven automation without hard-coding logic into workflows.
-   Playbook implementation: Provided step-by-step task guidance, improving user experience and process adherence.

These refinements streamlined request handling and improved overall user interaction.

Building on the request/fulfill model, the application was expanded to support departmental operations by:

-   Expanding the initial service request to include inquiry and issue workflows to support a broader range of user needs.
-   Enhancing the workspace dashboard for better visibility and management of ongoing requests.

This final phase transformed the initial MVP into a structured service management solution, offering a scalable approach for service requests, issue reporting, and inquiry submission within a department or group.

This lab demonstrated the rapid development of a ServiceNow application that delivers immediate business value, with the ability to expand and evolve post-initial release.

## Upgrading App Engine

This lab uses App Engine builders in ServiceNow Studio. If your version of ServiceNow Studio uses different builders for tables and workspaces, make sure to update App Engine Studio.

1.  In the filter navigator, search for `application manager`.
2.  Select **Application Manager**.
3.  Search for `App Engine Studio`.
4.  Select the **App Engine Studio** card and follow the steps to install or upgrade.

Outside of App Engine builders, this tutorial has no special requirements. The steps in this tutorial have been tested on a Yokohama release instance. If you're running into issues on an older instance, upgrading it might help.

1.  Open your account in [https://developer.service.now.com](https://developer.service.now.com).
2.  Select **Upgrade Instance**.
