# ServiceNow Studio supported file types using code search

ServiceNow Studio supports the following file types when using code search.

When using code search in ServiceNow Studio, the application uses the default code search group. The following table outlines the file types that are supported when using the default ServiceNow Studio code search.

**Tip:** If your company wants to expand the list of supported file types used in code search, an administrator can create a new code search group that includes additional file types. For more information about expanding code search, see [Expand code search tables](https://developer.servicenow.com/connect.do#!/share/contents/3024956_expand_code_search_tables?v=1&t=PRODUCT_DETAILS).

**Note:** To search for a file using code search, the file type must be extended from the sys\_metadata table. Other types of files, such as scheduled items \(sys\_trigger records\), are not searchable in ServiceNow Studio.
