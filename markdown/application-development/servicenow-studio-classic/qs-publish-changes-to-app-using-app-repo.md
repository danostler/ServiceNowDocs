# Publish app changes to the Application Repository from ServiceNow Studio

Publish changes that you have made to an app in ServiceNow Studio to the Application Repository \(App Repo\).

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or delegated developer

## About this task

The App Repo is one option ServiceNow offers for app deployment. You can also [create update sets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-development/servicenow-studio-classic/qs-create-update-set.md) to publish changes, or if your company has a deployment pipeline set up, you can deploy changes through the pipeline in ServiceNow Studio. For more information about the App Repo, see [ServiceNow application repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-development/application-repository-self-hosted/app-repo.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **ServiceNow Studio**.

2.  Open the **App details** page for the application that you want to update from either the ServiceNow Studio home page or the Navigator panel.

    -   On the ServiceNow Studio home page, select the **Deployment** tab. Then select **Applications** and select your application from the **Name** column.
