# Exploring UI generation

Learn how AI-generated UI experiences can empower developers building on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

## UI generation overview

Now Assist for Creator activates the UI generation skill. With UI generation, you provide text describing the UI experience and AI-powered Now Assist can get it started for you. Users with varying levels of experience can benefit from using UI generation to get started building experiences more efficiently.

## UI generation Workflow

To generate a UI experience, you describe the table, chart type, and navigation that your users work with. For the best results, you include as much detail as possible.

1.  The developer describes the desired experience and triggers UI generation.
2.  The developer reviews the AI-Generated experience and either accepts or rejects it.
    -   If the developer accepts it, the experience is saved and the developer can begin working with the experience.
    -   If the developer rejects it, the experience isn’t saved, and the developer can change the experience description to achieve the desired outcome.

## Client script summarization overview

Now Assist for Creator activates the client script summarization skill within the UI Builder. This skill provides you with both a high-level summary and a detailed explanation of a client script.

## Client script summarization workflow

1.  The developer logs in to an instance.
2.  The developer navigates to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **UI Builder** &gt; **.**
3.  The developer opens an experience with a client script.
4.  The developer selects one of the pages to open the page editor.
5.  From the Data and scripts panel, the developer opens a client script.

    The Explain Code panel appears if you have the ui\_builder\_admin role and have enabled the Client script summarization skill.

6.  The developer selects **Explain this code**.

    A concise summary, along with a detailed explanation of the script's functionality, is displayed.

7.  If the developer changes the script, a message in the Explain code panel notifies them of the update and asks whether the code should be explained again.

    The developer must select **Explain again** to generate a new summary.


## Data Binding Generation overview

Data Binding Generation enables you to state your requests in natural language. Now Assist then converts this input into a valid formula or data binding syntax, which is displayed in the Formula Builder for review, editing, and application. This skill helps to reduce user errors, eliminates the need to memorize syntax, and reduces the time required to configure data bindings.
