# Developer permissions

Using Manage Developers, administrators can assign one or more developer and deployment permissions to a group or user for a specific application. These permissions designate the specific actions the assigned user can perform for the application.

## Developer permissions

**Note:** If the App Collaboration component is installed, the link appears as **Manage Collaborators**.

|Source Control|Enables the assigned developer full access to source control.|
|All file types|Enables the assigned developer to access all application file types, including some not granted by the other options. This permission is equivalent to granting the user the admin role but with some limitations. Specifically, it provides access to all file types that are configured in your application via the Manage Developers task in the Application Creator.|
|Playbooks|Enables the assigned developer access to the Playbooks design environment to create processes. Editing activity subflows or actions requires the **Flow Designer** permission.|

|Manage Collaborators|Enables the assigned developer the ability to invite and manage users and groups. This permission enables the delegated developer to invite and manage other developers to the application.|
|Invite Collaborators|Enables the assigned developer the ability to invite users and groups. This permission enables the delegated developer to invite other developers to the application.|
|Delegated Admin|Enables access to all Delegated Development permissions so that permissions don’t need to be granted individually.**Note:** The SNC scripting role is also added.|

## Deployment permissions

Deployment, Manage Collaborators, and Invite Collaborators delegated development permission sets are only available with the Developer Collaborator feature. They don't show in **Manage Developers**.
