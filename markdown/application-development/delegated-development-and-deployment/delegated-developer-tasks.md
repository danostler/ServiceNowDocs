# Delegated Developer tasks

You can delegate deployment tasks \(application publishing, first-time installation, or update\) to developers or non-admin users, such as Change Management personnel.

## Delegated deployment tasks

You can delegate deployment tasks to specific users at the application level, or through assignment of specific user roles at the instance level.
