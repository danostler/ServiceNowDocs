# Remove a developer

Removing a user as a developer helps to prevent the accidental developing, changing, or deploying of an application in the current instance.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or application administrator

If [Application administration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-development/building-applications/application-administration.md) is enabled, only an application administrator of the target application can delegate developers to an application. If application administration isn’t enabled, an admin user can delegate developers.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **Applications**.

2.  Select the application name of the application from which you’re removing developers.

    The system opens the application record.

3.  Select **Manage Developers**.

    **Note:** If the App Collaboration Component is installed, the link appears as **Manage Collaborators**.

    The system displays the Developer Permissions window.

4.  Hover over the developer you want to remove.

    The system displays a minus icon next to the developer name.

5.  Select the minus icon next to the developer name.

    The system removes the developer and any associated application roles.
