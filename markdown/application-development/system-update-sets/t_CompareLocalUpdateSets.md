# Compare local update sets

Administrators can preview local and remote \(retrieved\) update sets and compare the sets with one another to resolve conflicting changes.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin.

## About this task

Compare local update sets to identify collisions and verify that the proper changes are being committed. Resolve all conflicts before moving an update set between instances.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Update Sets** &gt; **Local Update Sets**.

2.  Select the check boxes beside the update sets to compare.

3.  In the **Actions on selected rows** drop-down list, select **Compare Update Sets**.

    The progress screen appears as ServiceNow generates the collision report.

4.  Select **Go to the Collision Report** when the report is complete.

    The Update Set Collisions list appears, showing all the changes in the selected sets.

5.  Inspect the list for collisions by locating duplicate Collision Numbers that show the same change in separate update sets.

6.  Resolve the collision by deleting the unwanted update record from one of the update sets.

    1.  Select the check box besides the update list to open the update record, and select **Delete**.
    2.  **Note:** You can also delete the update records by selecting the check boxes for the entry in the Update Set Collisions list and select **Delete** from the **Actions on selected rows** drop-down list. When you delete the update record, the customization is not backed out of the instance. Only the record of the customization is deleted.

7.  Run the comparison again to make sure all collisions have been resolved.

## Update set collision resolution

A collision is an update that has a newer local update.

The platform detects collisions by comparing the values in the Name and Updated fields of the customer update record from each update set. If the name matches but there are different update date values, then there is a collision.

When a customer update is moved from one instance to another, it may be re-written to match the target instance. The re-write can involve changing the update name of the customer update and one or more `sys_id`s within the update. The re-writes are done when the record or the reference field is for a table that uses a coalesce strategy. This ensures that the customer update will be applied to the correct record. For example, if the `sys_dictionary` record for `tablename.fieldname` has `sys_id` `123456789` on instance A and `sys_id` `987654321` on instance B, when a customer update that refers to that record is retrieved from instance A and recorded in the sys\_update\_xml table on instance B, references to `123456789` are updated to read `987654321`.

### Coalesce strategies

Update sets can detect collisions between identical records that you independently create on separate instances. To detect such collisions, the record must have a coalesce strategy based on coalescing columns. Because collision detection depends on uniqueness of tables, the tables must be unique when the coalescing columns are combined. Records that are not listed here will not collide if the same record is created separately on different instances.

### How customer update record names affect collisions

To understand coalescing, it helps to understand how records that do not coalesce work. For most record types, when a customer update is moved to a new instance, the system does not detect collisions for the following reason:

-   When you create a record, it receives a unique sys\_id. For most record types, the sys\_id becomes part of the customer update record name. For example: `sysevent_email_template_9e1998c078b71100a92ecacd80df1d39`.
-   Creating an identical record in the same table on another instance produces a customer update record name with a different sys\_id. For example: `sysevent_email_template_10b958c8653311005840134572f8e020`

As a result, even though the records might be otherwise identical, the records have different names so the system does not detect the collision.

Coalescing records, in contrast, use the following approach to naming records and determining collisions: The following customer update record types use some or all of their coalescing columns instead of the sys\_id in their names.

-   sys\_dictionary
-   sys\_documentation
-   sys\_choice\_set
-   sys\_ui\_list
-   sys\_ui\_related\_list

The resulting identical record name in each instance helps the system to identify collisions even if the records have different sys\_ids.

When a customer update is moved from one instance to another, it may be re-written to match the target instance. The re-write can involve changing the update name of the customer update and one or more sys\_ids within the update. The re-writes are done when the record or the reference field is for a table that uses a coalesce strategy. This ensures that the customer update will be applied to the correct record. For example, if the sys\_dictionary record for tablename.fieldname has sys\_id "123456789" on instance A and sys\_id "987654321" on instance B, when a customer update that refers to that record is retrieved from instance A and recorded in the sys\_update\_xml table on instance B, references to "123456789" are updated to read "987654321".

### Preventing duplicate records

-   Transfer data with update sets rather than recreating it on separate instances to ensure the records have the same sys\_id.
-   Export and import records as XML files to ensure the records have the same sys\_id. See [Export and import XML files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/c_ExportAndImportXMLFiles.md).
-   Enable a unique index for the table from the system dictionary. See [Table administration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/c_TableAdministration.md).

**Note:** The default records included in the baseline system will always have the same Sys ID because the instance imports the records as XML files during instance provisioning.
