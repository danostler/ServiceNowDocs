Name

Enter a unique name for the update set. You can use naming conventions to organize update sets. For example, add the problem number to the name of the update that fixes it, identify the application scope, or use sequence numbers to keep track of the order in which update sets need to be committed.

State

Select **In progress** for a new update set. Selecting an In progress update set tracks customizations in the update set. The [update set picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-development/system-update-sets/select-update-set-system-settings.md) only displays In progress update sets.Select **Completed** only when you are certain that the update set is complete. After it is marked Completed, do not set it back to In progress. Instead, create a new update set with further customizations, and make sure to commit the update sets in the order that they were marked Completed. Use Completed update sets to transfer changes from one instance to another.

 Select **Ignore** when you are no longer working on an update set but do not want it to be transferred to another instance. You should always set Completed update sets on the production instance to Ignore. This state ensures the update set is not committed again when cloning the instance.
