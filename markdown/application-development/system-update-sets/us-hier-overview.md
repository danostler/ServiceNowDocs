# Working with batched update sets

Batch update sets enable you to group update sets together so you can preview and commit them in bulk.

Dealing with multiple update sets can lead to problems, including committing update sets in the wrong order or inadvertently leaving out one or more sets. You can avoid these problems by grouping completed update sets into a batch.

**Note:** To preserve the update set batch hierarchy while cloning, set only the parent update set to 'Ignore' status and leave all other update sets as 'Complete'. This will prevent batch sets from cloning and preserves the batch update set hierarchy.

The system organizes update set batches into a hierarchy. One update set can act as the parent for multiple child update sets. A given set can be both a child and parent, enabling multiple-level hierarchies. One update set at the top level of the hierarchy acts as the base update set.

When you preview or commit the base update set, you preview or commit the entire batch. The system determines the processing order, and checks for collisions, based on the dates the changes were recorded, and on their sequential ancestry. Their ancestries are the specific instances in which the changes in the update sets took place.

**Note:** For more details, see [Compare local update sets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-development/system-update-sets/t_CompareLocalUpdateSets.md) and [View customizations and compare with current version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-development/system-update-sets/view-customer-update-records.md).

## Example of batched update sets

The list of update set records reflects the batch hierarchy in the **Parent** and**Batch Base** columns.

-   **[Reorganize a batch of update sets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-development/system-update-sets/us-hier-reorg.md)**  
You can remove an individual update set from the batch or change its parent.
-   **[Back out batched update set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-development/system-update-sets/us-batch-backout.md)**  
Back out a batched update set by following the backout procedure for the base update set for the batch. You can also back out any child update set independently.
