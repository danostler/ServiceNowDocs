2.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **sys\_store.LIST**.

3.  Select the update set to configure in the store apps list.

4.  Select **Add app install to current update set** in the related links section.

    A message appears notifying you to confirm tracking app installs in the update set.

5.  You can also configure app installs by navigating to **All** &gt; **v\_plugin.LIST**

6.  Select the plugin to configure from the system plugin list.

7.  Select **Add app install to current update set** in the related links section.
