# Update set transfers

When an update set is completed, you can transfer it between instances to move customizations from development, through testing, and into production.

## Transferring with IP access control

If IP address access control is enabled on the source instance or the source instance resides in a different datacenter than the target instance, complete these tasks before transferring an update set:

1.  Contact Customer Service and Support to find out the IP addresses of all application nodes supporting your instance.
2.  On the source instance, navigate to System SecurityIP Address Access Control.Add the IP address from step one as an exception.

## Transferring with basic authentication

If the source instance has basic authentication turned on for SOAP requests, you must use valid credentials to retrieve update sets.

## Transferring with an XML file

You can unload an update set as an XML file and then transfer it to another instance. See [Save an update set as a local XML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-development/system-update-sets/t_SaveAnUpdateSetAsAnXMLFile.md) for details.
