# Code review notifications

You can enable email notifications on the instance requiring a code review.

The Team Development Code Review workflow sends notifications to members of the Team Development Code Reviewers group when:

-   A push requires code review.
-   You cancel a push.

If the developer who pushed the changes has a user record with an email address on the instance where code review was required. The developer receives a notification when the approval stage is set to Complete \(approved\) or Code Changes Rejected.

The code review notifications contain the following information:

<table id="table_qzf_1jv_1q"><thead><tr><th>
