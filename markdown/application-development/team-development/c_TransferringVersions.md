# Versions transferring

Administrators transfer version records between instances by moving customizations with update sets or the Team Development application.

## Update sets

Committing an update set adds a version record. For each update in the Update Set, the version that corresponds to the update is added on the local instance.

## Version transfers

|Transfer type|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|Pulling|Retrieves all versions of customized records that haven’t already been pulled from the parent instance. Customized records are added on the local instance.|
|Pushing|Adds only the current local version to the parent instance. All local versions aren't added.|
|Loading|Changes from peer instances add selected versions to the local instance.|
