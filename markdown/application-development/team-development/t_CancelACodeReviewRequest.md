# Cancel a code review request

Developers can cancel any push they submitted that is in the **Awaiting Code Review** stage.

## Before you begin

Role required: developer

## About this task

Canceling a request sets the push to the **Code Review Request Cancelled** stage on the submitting instance. The submitting instance retains a version history of the push but the parent instance doesn’t.

## Procedure

1.  Log in to the instance that you pushed the changes to.

2.  Navigate to **Team Development** &gt; **Pushes and Pulls**.

3.  Filter for the push you want to cancel.

    **Note:** You can’t cancel a push that has been approved or rejected.

4.  Select the Push record.

5.  Select **Cancel Code Review**.
