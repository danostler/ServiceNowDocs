# Revert a change

Undo changes to a customized record by reverting to an older version.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

**Note:** You can revert to the most recent baseline version. You can’t revert to an older baseline version.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to a list of version records for an object.

2.  Compare the current version to the older version to confirm that you’re reverting the desired changes.

3.  Select and hold \(or right-click\) the older version and select **Revert to this version**.

    A confirmation dialog box displays.

    **Note:** If reverting results in data loss, a warning message appears in the dialog box.

4.  Select **OK** to confirm the action.

    The current version is marked as a previous version.

5.  A new version record is added that duplicates the version that you selected in the preceding step.

    This new version is marked as the current version.
