# Granting access rights for the developers

To use Team Development, application developers must have a set of credentials for each instance in the Team Development hierarchy.

**Note:** The `teamdev_user` role doesn’t grant access to the Team Development application and isn’t intended for developers to work on local development instances. It’s intended to grant developers non-admin access to remote instances such as the parent instance or a peer development instance.

An instance's placement in the [team development hierarchy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-development/team-development/t_SetUpAnInstanceHierarchy.md) determines the credentials that it requires.
