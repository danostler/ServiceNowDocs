# Define a remote instance

For each instance, define other instances in the hierarchy as remote instances.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   admin role on the instance you’re registering.
-   teamdev\_user role on the instance you’re registering.

## About this task

This example demonstrates how to set up a remote instance for subdevelopment instances.

## Procedure

1.  If IP address access control is enabled, log in to the remote instance and add the subdevelopment instance as an exception.

2.  On the subdevelopment instance, navigate to **Team Development** &gt; **Remote Instances**.

3.  Select **New**.

4.  Define the remote instance, such as the parent development instance, by completing the form.

5.  Fill in the form.

<table id="table_mbs_gx1_bq"><thead><tr><th>

Name

</td><td>

Enter a unique name describing the instance.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Type

</td><td>

Specify whether the remote instance is a development, test, or UAT instance.

</td></tr><tr><td>
