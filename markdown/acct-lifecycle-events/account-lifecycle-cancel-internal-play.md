# Close or cancel an internal play

You can close or cancel an internal play and all the related tasks.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_acct\_lc.customer\_success\_agent

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspace** &gt; **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace** and click the **List** icon.

2.  Navigate to the **Customer Success** &gt; **All Internal Plays** and open the internal play you want to cancel.

3.  Click the **Record details** to view the internal play record form.

4.  Depending on your requirement, change the State to **Canceled** or **Closed**.

    The Closure code is automatically updated to reflect the State change.

5.  Ensure that all the mandatory fields are filled out and click **Save**.

6.  Click **Yes** in the confirmation window to continue.

    The internal play along with all associated child internal play tasks will be canceled or closed and the Progress is set to **Finished**.

    **Note:**

    -   Before you close an internal play, you must ensure that no associated child tasks are open. If an associated child task is still open, a warning message is displayed. You must first close or cancel the child tasks and then proceed with closing the internal play task.
    -   When you try to **Cancel** an internal play, you will see a confirmation message indicating that all child tasks will be canceled. Click **Yes** to continue and cancel the internal play.
