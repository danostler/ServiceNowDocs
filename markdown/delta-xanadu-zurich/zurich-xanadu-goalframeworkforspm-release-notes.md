After upgrading to Goal Framework for SPM v2.3.0, run the **Migrate BreakdownInterval To Checkinfrequency** scheduled job. This scheduled job migrates the existing values in the **Review frequency** and **Breakdown interval** fields to the **Check-in frequency** field in the target records. For more information on how these values are migrated for targets with different values, see [Target breakdowns migration](https://servicenow-staging.fluidtopics.net/access?context=target-breakdowns-migration&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).
