3.  In the **Enable CAM Workflow Configuration** pop-up page, read the impact listed under **Turning this property on will update your CAM experience**.

    The impacts to the CAM experience when you enable the CAM workflow configuration.

    -   Your current homepage widgets and layout will change.
    -   Existing package flows may not work until data-migration is done.
    -   Any custom workflow changes will need to be managed separately.
    -   New boundaries and packages will not be affected.
    -   Once enabled, this property cannot be turned off.
