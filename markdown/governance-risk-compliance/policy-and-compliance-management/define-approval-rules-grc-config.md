# Define the policy exception approval rules

Approval rules define how policy exception requests are reviewed and approved, enabling organizations to create customized, multi-level workflows.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_compliance.manager to create the policy exception approval rules.

## About this task

Approval rules enable organizations to create customized, multi-level workflows for reviewing and approving policy exception requests based on specific filter conditions. These rules support dynamic assignment of approvers and allow configuration of approval requirements at each level. Once configured, requests are automatically routed to the designated approvers, streamlining the approval process.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Assignment and Approval Configurations** &gt; **Approval Configurations**.

    The GRC Approval Configurator is shipped with default template for approval called **Policy Exception - Approval Config**.

2.  Select **Policy Exception - Approval Config**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

 By default, State is set to Awaiting Approval. This is a mandatory condition.

 You can set other filter conditions as well. Use logical operators such as AND or OR to build complex condition sets.

</table>4.  Add approval levels to the configuration in the Approval Levels table.

    A default approval level called **Approval Config - Level 1** is already set up. You can add multiple levels for the configuration. Each level can have its own rules, assigned users or groups, and triggering conditions.

5.  Select **Verification Config - Level 1**.

6.  On the form, change the following fields:

<table id="table_zgr_qyx_rgc"><thead><tr><th>

-   **Approver from source**: Select approvers that are based on values from the source table. You can select a user field, a group field, or both to determine approvers dynamically from the source record.
-   **Dynamic approvers**: Define approvers dynamically using the source. Apply static or advanced dynamic conditions to filter approvers. You can select a user field, group field, or both to determine who should approve.
