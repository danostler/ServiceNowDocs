# Summarize a compliance case using the GRC case summarization skill

Use the GRC case summarization skill to generate an AI summary of a compliance case. The summary provides a consolidated view of a compliance case record.

## Before you begin

**Important:** This skill is turned on by default if you have Now Assist for IRM installed. The skill is automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see .

Role required:

-   sn\_comp\_case.compliance\_case\_analyst: Grants access to compliance case records.
-   sn\_grc\_sharegenai.grc\_case\_ai\_user: Grants users access to use the GRC case summarization skill.

## About this task

Compliance cases can span multiple action tasks, stakeholders, and regulatory requirements. The GRC case summarization skill generates a concise AI summary of key case details, so case analysts and managers can quickly understand the context and take informed action.

The skill collects data from predefined fields across the compliance case record. This data is assembled into a prompt and sent to the configured large language model \(LLM\) service provider, which then returns a structured summary.

**Important:** Be sure to check AI-generated summaries for accuracy.

If the **Summarize** option isn’t visible, the skill has to be activated by an admin. For instructions, refer to [Activate the GRC case summarization skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/grc-common-functions/activate-grc-case-summarization-skill.md).
