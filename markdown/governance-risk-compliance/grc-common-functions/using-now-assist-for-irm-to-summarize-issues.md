# Using Now Assist for Integrated Risk Management \(IRM\) skills

Use the generative AI skills that are supported by the Now Assist for Integrated Risk Management \(IRM\) application for quick actions with issues.

Now Assist for IRM leverages generative AI to streamline risk and compliance processes. It provides pre-built skills and supports custom skill development for tasks like summarization, recommendations, and rationalization.

**Important:** Some Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows are turned on by default. For more information, see .

These skills are configured via the Now Assist Admin console.

By default, all skills exist in the global domain. When you use Now Assist in a domain-separated environment, users are only able to access data in their domain. For example, if a user uses the summarization skill, Now Assist only uses material that exists in the user's domain when generating that summary. Additionally, there is no co-mingling of data for domain-separated instances when using generative AI skills. The data resides only on the instance, and the shared services used for generative AI do not persist any requests \(prompts\) and responses. For more information, see . \(Note that global domain is not the same as global scope. For more information, see .\)
