# AI-generated recommendations for similar control objectives

The recommendations framework is designed to deliver actionable, AI-driven recommendations for similar control objectives directly within the user interface. It provides rich contextual information about similar control objectives, empowering users to make well-informed decisions and take follow-up actions seamlessly.

The Control objective deduplication and rationalization feature is designed to help compliance managers and analysts streamline their compliance processes by identifying, deduplicating, and rationalizing similar control objectives within their compliance library. This feature leverages AI to automate the identification of redundant control objectives, helping to make it easier to maintain a clean and efficient compliance library.

## Highlights of the recommendation framework

-   **Configurable recommendations and actions**
    -   Enable you to define and configure recommendations for various record types.
    -   Enable setup of follow-up actions, so you can act on recommendations directly within the workflow.
-   **Intelligent recommendations**
    -   Leverage advanced AI capabilities, including generative AI and Predictive Intelligence, to display relevant recommendations.
    -   Continuously improve insights and recommendations by incorporating machine learning models and predictive scoring.
-   **Scalable design**
    -   Support the display of multiple recommendations for a single record type.
    -   Provide flexibility for administrators to customize the layout and structure of the recommendation panel according to business needs.
    -   Adapt to a variety of record types and recommendation techniques, confirming consistency and scalability across use cases.
-   **Adoption enablement**
    -   Designed for rapid integration and adoption across upstream products.
    -   Offer a user-friendly, intuitive interface that empowers decision-makers with clear, actionable insights.

-   Faster adoption for products looking to leverage AI/ML-based recommendations.
-   Customizable workflows and logic to meet specific organizational processes.
-   Improved user productivity with actionable recommendations and clear next steps built directly into the interface.

**Note:** Only users with sn\_reco\_template.rationalization\_process\_writer and sn\_grc\_shared\_genai.compliance\_gen\_ai\_user can see the option to generate recommendations for similar control objective. This role must be manually assigned to a compliance user.

To generate recommendations for a control objective, configure Now Assist for Integrated Risk Management \(IRM\). See [Configure Now Assist for Integrated Risk Management \(IRM\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/governance-risk-compliance/grc-common-functions/configure-now-assist-for-irm.md).
