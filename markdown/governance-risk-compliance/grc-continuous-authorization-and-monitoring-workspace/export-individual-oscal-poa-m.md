# Export OSCAL POA&amp;M from list view

Export selected Plans of Action and Milestones \(POA&amp;M\) records from the CAM list to an Open Security Controls Assessment Language \(OSCAL\) format.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.admin, sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.system\_owner, sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.authorization\_official, sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.info\_system\_sec\_manager, or sn\_irm\_cont\_auth.info\_system\_sec\_officer

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CAM Workspace**.

2.  In the CAM Workspace, select the List icon \(\[Omitted image "ws-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: List\).

3.  Select **All POA&amp;Ms** from the **Continuous monitoring** list.

4.  Select the POA&amp;Ms from the list that you want to export.

    \[Omitted image "cam-oscal-individual-export-poa-m1.png"\] Alt text: Selecting individual POA&amp;M files.

5.  Select **OSCAL Export** to export the selected POA&amp;M files.

    **Note:** Verify that the pop-up blocker is turned off for the URL so that the POA&amp;M zip file is automatically downloaded to your local repository.


## Result

-   OSCAL POA&amp;M export is a synchronous process. Once the file is generated, it downloads automatically as a zip file in your local repository.
-   When POA&amp;Ms are associated with different authorization packages, CAM generates a zip file containing individual JSON files for each authorization package.
