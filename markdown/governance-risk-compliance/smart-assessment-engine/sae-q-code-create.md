# Create a code question

Enable the assessors to respond to a question by using entering a barcode number or scanning a QR code in an assessment.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_smart\_asmt.template\_manager or sn\_smart\_asmt.assessment\_admin

**Note:** Users with the sn\_smart\_asmt.template\_manager role must also have the appropriate template category role assigned.

## Procedure

1.  You can update an assessment template by either opening an existing template from the landing page or by creating a new template and saving it.

    |Option|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |**Existing template**|On the Assessment Workspace landing page, select an existing template in draft state.|
    |**New template**|Create a template as described in [Add instructions and questions to an assessment template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/governance-risk-compliance/smart-assessment-engine/sae-asmnt-template-populate.md).|

2.  On the **Questions** tab for the template, select the section that you want to add the question to and then select **Add question**.

3.  In the **Type** section, select **Code**.

4.  Enter the barcode manually or select scanner and scan the QR code.

    The Preview section displays an example of the text box with the code or scanned QR code that the assessor uses for the response.

5.  Specify any number of attributes for the question.

<table id="choicetable_afm_5mq_mbc"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d210988e145">

Attribute

</th><th align="left" id="d210988e148">

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td id="d210988e154">

**Required**

</td><td>

If the assessor must answer the question in order to submit the assessment, select **Required**. The assessor sees the \* \(asterisk\) character to indicate that a response is required.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d210988e171">

**Conditionally visible**

</td><td>

Option in the additional attributes menu \(\[Omitted image "AlertMenuIcon.png"\] Alt text: Additional attributes menu icon.\).

 Select this attribute if the question appears to the assessor only if the response to a different question meets the conditions that you specify.

 Use the condition builder to specify the conditions that are required to present this question to the assessor.

 You specify the section, subsection \(if available\), question, and, optionally, the response. Together, the values that you specify define the conditions that must be met for the question to appear in the assessment.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d210988e200">

**Justification**

</td><td>

Option in the additional attributes menu \(\[Omitted image "AlertMenuIcon.png"\] Alt text: Additional attributes menu icon.\).

 Enable the assessor to supply the additional text information that justifies a response. This option is useful when you expect that some responses will be nonstandard.

 In the assessment, the \* \(asterisk\) character appears on the field for a required justification.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d210988e226">

**Attachments**

</td><td>

Option in the additional attributes menu \(\[Omitted image "AlertMenuIcon.png"\] Alt text: Additional attributes menu icon.\).

Request the attachments for the specific responses. You can specify that the attachments are: -   Required
-   Optional
-   The request for the attachments appears only if the response meets the conditions that you specify.

Use the condition builder to specify the conditions. The values that you specify define the conditions that must be met to enable the assessor to add the attachments.

**Specify preferred answers**

</td><td>

Option in the additional attributes menu \(\[Omitted image "AlertMenuIcon.png"\] Alt text: Additional attributes menu icon.\).
