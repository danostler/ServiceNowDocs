# Landing page and dashboard views

The landing page in the Operational Resilience Workspace provides a single-pane overview of the services, business services, and pillars in your organization. The dashboard displays resilience metrics, including operational status, completed activities, red flags, and suggestions for improvement.

The flexible data model introduced with Operational Resilience, Release 21.0.x provides a foundation for the dashboards and tracks the flow of dependent services. The data, including red flags by type, such as failed controls, incidents, and outages, and business service metrics such as number of flags, importance, and impact tolerance, is updated in the dashboard through changes to the flexible data model.

\[Omitted image "dashboard-data.png"\] Alt text: Dashboard data.

The data shown in the example is for business services such as business service by number of red flags, business service by importance, business service by impact tolerance. You can change it service offerings, business processes, or application services by configuring the **sn\_oper\_res.top\_class\_name** property. You can then change the top class to another object and the system shows data with respect to that specific top class.

## Calculation and roll up of red flags

The dashboard shown in the earlier example displays a range of 1-30 red flags. Upon selecting, it shows a detailed breakdown, showing a total of 20 red flags, with 3 specifically attributed to the "cards and payments" level. This illustrates the roll-up functionality, which aggregates red flags beneath the selected "Cards and Payments" business service, providing a hierarchical view of the data.

\[Omitted image "red-flags-breakup.png"\] Alt text: red flags.

The value "24" shown in the Total red flags count column is the roll-up value of the red flags for all entities under the "Cards and Payments" business service.

The **Calculate red flags for CSDM and dependencies** scheduled job does not create new records in the \[sn\_oper\_res\_profile\] table. Instead, it recomputes the impacted objects for the existing sn\_oper\_res\_profile records using data from the \[sn\_grc\_m2m\_profile\_profile\] table.

The **Calculate red flags for CSDM and dependencies** scheduled job fetches the red flags for the profiles in the \[sn\_oper\_res\_profile\] table only when the following conditions are met:

-   The **sn\_oper\_res\_profile.pillar** is not empty.
-   The **sn\_oper\_res\_profile.applies\_to** field is not empty.

The red flags fetching mechanism can use either the **sn\_oper\_res\_profile.profile** condition, the **sn\_oper\_res\_profile.applies\_to** condition, or a combination of both.

The red flags also inherit the impacted objects and impacted object classes from the \[sn\_oper\_res\_profile\] record. For example if an application service's Operational Resilience profile lists Business service, Offering, and Business process as impacted objects \(shown in the Impacted objects column\), these objects are copied to all associated red flags for the application service and its related entities.

**Note:** The \[sn\_oper\_res\_profile\] record is created for an entity that is created without the **applies\_to** record. When an entity is linked properly to its respective records, integrations with risks, failed controls, incidents, and issues function properly.

## Conditions for calculating the red flags

This section uses the **sn\_oper\_res\_profile.profile** and **sn\_oper\_res\_profile.applies\_to** conditions for reference. The criteria for calculating red flags and the relevant tables are detailed in the Red flags calculation table.

A joint query is performed using the two tables and \[sn\_grc\_issue\] is fetched for the service, business service, and offering.

## Sample query conditions for Operational Resilience integration

The Operational Resilience application uses entities to integrate with Risk Management, Advanced Risk, and Policy and Compliance Management. Operational Resilience uses the **applies\_to** value of an entity to integrate with other tables. To illustrate how these integrations work, the following table provides examples of query conditions for various integration types, demonstrating the role of Entity and **applies\_to** in facilitating these connections.
