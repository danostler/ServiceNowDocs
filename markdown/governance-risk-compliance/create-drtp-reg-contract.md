# Create a contract and enhance digital resilience data

Create a contract record in Digital resilience third-party registers where you add details of the contract such as vendor name, start and end dates, state, substate, and so on. You can then enhance its digital resilience information for compliance with DORA regulation.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_oper\_res.manager

## About this task

The Digital resilience third-party registers include details about who within your organization is using externally outsourced ICT services, which functions and branches are using them, and who the third-party providers and their engagements are. The contracts link these two aspects together.

The contracts link both parties—those using the information and those providing it. Essentially, they bind legal entities, branches, and functions to third parties and third-party engagements.

You can navigate to the contracts from the Contracts menu item in Digital resilience third-party registers. Alternately, you can navigate to the legal entities record, open the Legal entities tab, and navigate to the contracts.
