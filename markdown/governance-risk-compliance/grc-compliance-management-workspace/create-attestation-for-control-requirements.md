## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_compliance.admin, sn\_compliance.manager, sn\_compliance.user

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Policy and Compliance** &gt; **Compliance Workspace**.

4.  Select the control that contains the control requirements you want to attest.

5.  In the **Details** tab, select **Take Attestation at Requirement Level**.

6.  In the **Assign Respondent** field, specify the user or role responsible for attestation \(for example, System Administrator\).

7.  Select **Attest**.

8.  Navigate to the **Control requirements** tab, and select each control requirement.

    Attestation tasks are generated for each control requirement under Assessment Instances.

    1.  Select either Yes \(implemented\) or No \(not implemented\).

        -   If yes, attach evidence and provide an explanation.

    -   Marks the parent control as non-compliant.
    -   Rolls up the same status to the entity and control objective level.
