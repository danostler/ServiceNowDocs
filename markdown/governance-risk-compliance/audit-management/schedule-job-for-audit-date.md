# Schedule job for audit date enhancement

Scheduled Jobs are automated pieces of work that can be performed at a specific time or on a recurring schedule. Execute this scheduled job to enable enhanced audit date behavior.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

2.  Enter **Audit date enhancements** in the filter search bar to search for the audit date-scheduled jobs.\[Omitted image "Scheduled-Jobs-Audit-Date-Enhancements.png"\] Alt text: Searching audit date enhancement scheduled jobs

3.  Select **Audit date enhancements** from the search result list.

4.  Select **Execute Now** to schedule the audit date enhancement job.


## Result

The scheduled job will update the behavior for the following tables:

-   Engagement \(sn\_audit\_engagement\)
-   Audit Task \(sn\_audit\_task\)
-   Control Test \(sn\_audit\_control\_test\)
-   Walkthrough \(sn\_audit\_walkthrough\)
