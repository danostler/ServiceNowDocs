# Edit a question in Catalog Builder

Edit an existing question if you want to improve it by adding dynamic form behavior.

## Before you begin

Role required: catalog\_builder\_editor, catalog\_admin, or admin

## About this task

Set values for the fields and condition-based field messages. Make the question mandatory, visible, or read-only based on your requirements. You can also deactivate the question.

You can’t edit the questions that belong to single-row and multi-row variable sets.

-   If the question is used in a published catalog item, you can’t delete it but you can mark it as inactive. You can include such questions again in the catalog item by using the **Insert De-activated questions** option.
-   Removing a new question that has never been published deletes the question.
-   You can’t remove questions of types that aren't allowed in the template or supported in the Catalog Builder.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Catalog** &gt; **Catalog Builder**.

2.  Select the **Catalog items** tab.

3.  Select a catalog item and navigate to the **Questions** tab.

4.  Deactivate a question.

    1.  Point to the question and select the deactivate icon \(\[Omitted image "deactivate-quest.png"\] Alt text: Deactivate icon.\).

    2.  In the dialog box, select **Deactivate**.

5.  Edit a question.

    1.  Point to the question and select the edit icon \(\[Omitted image "edit-quest-builder.png"\] Alt text: Edit icon.\).

    2.  Make the required changes and select **Save**.

    **Note:** If you want to add UI policies to the question, use UI Policy tab to add them.
