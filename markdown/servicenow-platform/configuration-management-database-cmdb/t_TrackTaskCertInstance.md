# Track a task with a certification instance

The Certification Tasks related list on the certification instance record provides information about associated tasks.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The State field on the certification instance record is read-only and is based on the cumulative states of the certification tasks associated with the instance. The Percent complete column allows users with the certification\_admin role to track task progress quickly. For more information, see [Track Certification Tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/servicenow-platform/configuration-management-database-cmdb/t_TrackACertificationTask.md).
