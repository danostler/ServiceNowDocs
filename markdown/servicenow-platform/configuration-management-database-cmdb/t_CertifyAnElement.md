7.  To see the certified or failed element, set the view to Show All Records.

    A green check mark or red exclamation mark appears beside the element.

8.  Point to an icon to see any certification comments.

9.  Ensure that all elements have the correct certification, either accepted or rejected.

    After you certify all elements, no elements can be [reverted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/servicenow-platform/configuration-management-database-cmdb/c_ResetCertifications.md). When all elements of a certification task are certified or rejected, the task State changes to Closed Complete.
