# Accessing the connection details of Service Graph Connectors

The common connection framework \(CCF\) included within the Integration Commons for CMDB \(sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\) store app enables accessing connection details of Service Graph Connectors in a single view.

With the CCF, you can access all the connections used by Service Graph Connectors or the connections that are specific to a Service Graph Connector. The connection details include the connection alias, connection properties, data sources, and scheduled data imports associated with a connection for a Service Graph Connector.

## Viewing connections

To view the connection details for all Service Graph Connectors that use the CCF, navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Graph Connectors** &gt; **Connections** from the application navigator.

If a Service Graph Connector uses CCF, you can also view the connections specific to the connector. To view the connection details, open the Service Graph Connector from the application navigator, access its Connections module to view the Service Graph Connections list, and then select the connection name.

The Service Graph Connections page displaying the connection details also includes the **Test Connection** related link that you can select to test the connection. If the connection is successful, a success message is displayed. Else, an error message with the reason of failure is displayed.

## CCF tables

The CCF uses the following tables:

-   **Service Graph Connections \[sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\_service\_graph\_connection\]**

    Stores the connection records for all the Service Graph Connectors that use the CCF. The Service Graph Connections \[sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\_service\_graph\_connection\] table also includes other CCF tables as related lists.

-   **Properties \[sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\_service\_graph\_connection\_property\]**

    Stores the connection properties associated with a specific connection.

-   **Service Graph Connection Data Sources \[sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\_service\_graph\_connection\_data\_source\]**

    Stores the many-to-many \(m2m\) connection details between the Service Graph Connections \[sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\_service\_graph\_connection\] table and the data sources for a Service Graph Connector.

-   **Service Graph Connection Scheduled Data Imports \[sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\_service\_graph\_connection\_scheduled\_data\_import\]**

    Stores the m2m connection details between the Service Graph Connections \[sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\_service\_graph\_connection\] table and the scheduled data imports for a Service Graph Connector.

-   **Service Graph Connection Test Script \[sn\_cmdb\_int\_util\_service\_graph\_connection\_test\_script\]**

    Stores records that include scripts for triggering the test connection process for Service Graph Connectors.
