# Interaction records in Workspace

Using an interaction record, agents can create or reference customer information from a customer contact. Agents can then decide if the conversation is an incident, case, or request.

An interaction represents a request for assistance made through a chat, phone call, or walk-up. Interactions can be routed to queues for assignment or assigned to agents directly. Support agents can create cases, requests, or incidents from the interaction. Interactions can also be used to capture one-and-done type requests where an agent might not want to create associated tasks.

</table>While you are on an interaction, tasks that are viewed or created under the interaction are automatically logged on the Interaction Related tasks.

## Associating user profiles on messaging interactions

When a requester sends a message, the system checks whether the identifier matches an existing channel user profile. Channel user profiles are used to track the identities of conversation participants using an identifier associated with the source of the message. For SMS messages, the identifier is the phone number from which the message was sent.

<table id="table_dxp_vwy_gmb"><tbody><tr><td>

If there is a matching channel user profile

</td><td>

-   A new interaction is started.
-   Or the message is associated with an ongoing interaction for the matching channel user profile.

</td></tr><tr><td>

If there is no matching channel user profile

</td><td>

-   A new channel user profile is created.
-   A new interaction referencing the new channel user profile is created.
-   If the identifier matches a user, it populates the User document field of the channel user profile and the Opened for field of the interaction with a reference to that user.
