## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **Theme Builder**.

    The Theme Builder landing page displays in the Home page view.

2.  From the Home page view, select the Manager page view to see [the themes you have created](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-user-interface/configure-user-experiences/tb-create-theme.md).

    **Important:** When you have selected the theme you want to work on, verify that you have selected the correct scope for the theme from the application scope picker.

    \[Omitted image "tb-available-themes.png"\] Alt text: Manager page view with available published themes.

3.  Select the theme to which you want to add an alternate color palette to.

    -   For published or unpublished themes without an alternate color palette already defined, select the More actions icon \(\[Omitted image "tb-more-actions.png"\] Alt text:\), and select **Add alternate color palette**.\[Omitted image "tb-select-alt-color-pal.png"\] Alt text: Add an alternate color palette.
    -   For a published or unpublished theme group, which has alternate color palettes defined, navigate to the Edit drop-down list and select **Add an alternate color palette**.
    The alternate color palette wizard appears.

    \[Omitted image "tb-provide-color-palette.png"\] Alt text: First, name your alternate color palette.

4.  Enter a **Theme group name** and the **Color Palette name**, then choose from either **Light Palette** or **Dark Palette**.

5.  Select **Create color palette**.

    **Note:** The alternate color palette uses the same font, shapes, and logo as the primary theme. To edit those styles, edit the primary theme.

    The Editor page for the current palette appears.

6.  On this screen, perform the following actions:

    -   In the **Color palette name** field, change the color palette name.
    -   Select any of the three brand colors defined in this palette and change them from the color picker.

        **Note:** For dark palettes, only the primary color can be edited. If you want to customize further, see [Edit components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-user-interface/configure-user-experiences/tb-edit-components.md).


## Result

The alternate color palette is added to your primary theme. The theme name now appears as a theme group with the palette recorded under the Color palette drop-down list.\[Omitted image "tb-color-palette-list.png"\] Alt text: Color palette drop-down list.

If your theme is currently published, your alternate color palette is available for selection in the user's Theme preferences.
