# Configuring a form action to open a custom modal

Configure a form action to open a custom modal that provides information or interactive elements without navigating away from the current page.

Buttons execute actions in your configurable workspace. Custom modals provide information or interactive elements without navigating away from the current page through pop-up boxes. Integrating custom modals with action buttons creates a seamless and interactive experience, enabling you to perform actions intuitively.

## Processes for creating a custom modal

Configuring an action button to open a custom modal involves several processes:

1.  Adding the action button to the form:

    Creating an action adds the button to the form without assigning it to do anything when selected. For more information, see [Create a form action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-user-interface/configure-user-experiences/create-a-new-form-action.md).

2.  Activating Customer Service Management:

    Adding the Customer Service plugin provides demo data and activates related plugins that are not already active. For more information, see Activate Customer Service Management.

3.  Opening your record page in UI Builder:

    Accessing your record page in UI Builder enables you to design and configure the page variant with a custom modal. For more information, see Create a page variant.

4.  Designing the page variant in UI Builder:

    Using UI Builder to design a page variant passes the modal into the workspace record page. For more information, see [Design a page variant in UIB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-user-interface/configure-user-experiences/design-a-page-variant-in-uib.md).

5.  Configuring the page variant as a modal in UI Builder:

    Using UI Builder to configure the page variant defines the modal to appear in the workspace record page. For more information, see [Configure a page variant as a modal in UIB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-user-interface/configure-user-experiences/configure-a-page-variant-as-a-modal-in-uib.md).

6.  Creating a UX add-on event mapping:

    Setting up a UX add-on event mapping connects the action button to your custom modal. For more information, see [Create a UX add-on event mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-user-interface/configure-user-experiences/create-a-ux-add-on-event-mapping.md).

7.  Defining the payload for a custom modal:

    Configuring the payload sets the action button to open the custom modal in your workspace. For more information, see [Define the payload for a custom modal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-user-interface/configure-user-experiences/define-the-payload-for-a-custom-modal.md).
