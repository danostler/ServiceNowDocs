# Configuring digital signature and encryption for emails

Configure emails that send a digital signature to verify you as an authentic sender and an email encryption to certify authentic recipients.

A digital signature verifies the email sender and assures recipients that the email came from a trusted source and wasn't altered. In the email composer for Configurable Workspace, you can select a check box to digitally sign outbound emails.

Encryption makes the email unreadable to anyone except the intended recipient. In the email composer for Configurable Workspace, you can select a check box to encrypt outbound emails.

## Digital signature and encryption configuration

To use digital signature or encryption for emails in Configurable Workspace, configure S/MIME for your instance. For information on S/MIME and instructions to configure S/MIME for emails, see Setting up S/MIME for email.

Configuring S/MIME for emails requires the following steps:

-   **Import an S/MIME key pair**

    Import an S/MIME key pair consisting of the private key and certificate to sign outbound emails or decrypt emails.

-   **Upload a CA certificate**

    Upload a digital CA \(Certificate Authority\) certificate to validate email certificates for secure communication.

-   **Upload an email certificate**

    Upload an email certificate to validate a signature for inbound email or encrypt an outbound email or both for secure communication.

-   **Enable S/MIME**

    Configure S/MIME settings for inbound and outbound email.
