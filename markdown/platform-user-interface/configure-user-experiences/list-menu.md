# Using lists to find work to do

Use lists in workspace to see high-priority issues and which issues are assigned to you.

To get to list view, click the list icon \(\[Omitted image "list-icon-black.png"\] Alt text: List icon\).

You see two tabs of lists: **Lists** and **My Lists**. The system administrator creates the list categories in **Lists**. You create the list categories in **My Lists**.

## List categories

List categories in the previous image are **Tasks**, **SLAs**, and **Incidents**. List categories are not clickable and therefore serve mainly as headings for the list filters beneath them. For example, under the list category, **Tasks**, are the list filters, **My Work** and **My Group's Work**.

\[Omitted image "list-category-list-fields.png"\] Alt text: List view

Your system administrator sets up the list categories, which typically correspond with the tables in the database. For example, all incidents are stored in the incident table. All interactions are stored in the interaction table. The list categories your system administrator chooses to display in list view correspond to the kinds of issues you work on. If you work on incidents, your system administrator shows incidents in the **Lists** column. If you work on cases, the **Lists** column shows cases.

You can use the up arrowhead icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-arrowhead-up.png"\] Alt text: Collapse icon\) to display the list filters under each list category. Clicking the down arrowhead icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-arrowhead-down.jpg"\] Alt text: Collapse icon\) collapses the list categories to make it easier to scroll through the list categories.

You cannot have a list category without list filters.

## List filters

List filters are the subsections under list categories. In the previous image, under **Tasks**, you see **My Work** and **My Group's Work**. Each list filter provides a helpful grouping of records typically from one table. For example, **My Cases** enables you to quickly find cases assigned to you. Your system administrator creates the list filters.

Clicking a list filter opens the corresponding list of records in list view. A list filter must belong to a list category in the **Lists** tab.

## My Lists

Any lists that you create appear in this section. Lists in this section are only visible to you. For more information about creating your own list categories and list filters, see [Create My Lists in workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-user-interface/configure-user-experiences/create-filtered-list-agent-workspace.md).
