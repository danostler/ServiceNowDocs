# Customize a page variant in UI Builder

Configure a UI Builder page variant to pass from a workspace modal into the variant. This step acts as part of the process to configure an action button to open a custom modal.

## Before you begin

Complete the following actions:

-   [Create a form action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-user-interface/configure-user-experiences/create-a-new-form-action.md)
-   [Activate Customer Service Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/customer-service-management/t_ActivateCustomerService.md)
-   Open your record page in UI Builder or create a page variant in UI Builder

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Open your page variant.

2.  Add components to display on the page by selecting **+Add component** under the Body element.

3.  Select the added component and select the **Table** field.

4.  Switch the setting to **Bind data** and dot-walk to the table prop by entering `@context.props.table`.

5.  Select the **Title** field, and switch to **Script** mode.

6.  Enter the following script and pass the sysID received through the URL parameter as a JS template variable.

    ```
    function evaluateProperty({ api, helpers }) {
    	return `Only ${api.context.props.sysId}`;
    }
    ```

7.  Select **Apply** for the script and select **Save**.


## Result

The table and sysID variables are configured to be passed from the modal through the URL into the variant.
