# Create My Lists in workspace

Create your own filtered lists in workspace to monitor your issues, tasks, or problems, under **My Lists**.

## Before you begin

Role required: agent\_workspace\_user

## About this task

Create different groupings of records than those provided by your system administrator under the **Lists** tab. For example, you might like to group all records that pertain to incidents associated with a specific company. You can create another version of an existing list, or create an entirely new one. Those lists are only visible to you. To access your lists, select **My Lists**.
