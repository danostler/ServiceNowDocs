# Set the presentation order of your Theme Builder themes

Set the order of your Theme Builder themes to configure how they’re displayed in the user's Theme preferences.

## Before you begin

-   Before setting the order of your themes, verify that you have more than one theme published. For more information on publishing your Theme Builder themes, see [Publish your themes with Theme Builder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/platform-user-interface/configure-user-experiences/tb-apply-theme.md).
-   Verify that you have selected the correct scope for the theme from the application scope picker.

Role required: admin

## About this task

Setting the order to your Theme Builder themes enables you to control how your themes are displayed in the Next Experience Theme user preference.

Currently, setting order to your themes is only available to web instances. Mobile instances can only accommodate one published theme at a time.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **Theme Builder**.

    The Theme Builder landing page appears in the Home page view.

2.  From the Home page view, select the Manager page view to see the themes that you have created.

3.  Select the List view to view a list of your published and unpublished themes.

    \[Omitted image "tb-list-view.png"\] Alt text: List view.

4.  From the Published section, hover over your chosen theme and drag the theme into the order you prefer.

    The default theme is treated as the first theme that is displayed in the Next Experience Theme user preference. If you delete or move the default theme from its position, then the next theme listed becomes the default. If a user has not made a selection from the Theme user preference, the default theme is displayed. Each theme listed after the default theme follows a sequential order and is displayed in that order in the user's Theme preference.

    **Note:** If you have themes that are created outside of Theme Builder, the order displayed might not be reflective of all the themes available in the Theme user preference.
