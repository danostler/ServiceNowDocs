# Transfer a chat to another queue

Route a chat to another queue. Any agent who belongs to the associated queue can accept the chat.

## Before you begin

Role required: workspace\_user

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workspace Home** &gt; **Inbox**.

2.  On the Action toolbar, select the transfer to queue icon \(\[Omitted image "TransferQueueIcon.png"\] Alt text: Transfer to queue icon.\).

3.  In the Transfer to Queue panel, select the queue to transfer the chat to.

    When you transfer a chat, the current work item associated with the interaction is marked as closed complete. A new work item is associated with the new queue and the chat is added to the selected queue. When a receiving agent accepts the transfer, that agent sees the conversation and the chat history in the Active Chat panel. When you’re transferred from a live agent back to a queue, the logic doesn’t check for live agents, and the chat goes to the queue to be picked up by an agent.
