# Set up a new chat or work item alert

Set up an audible alert to notify you when a new chat or work item arrives in your Agent Workspace inbox. Only agents who are subscribed to the corresponding service channel can change the settings.

## Before you begin

-   Install the Agent Chat plugin \(com.glide.interaction.awa\).
-   Enable Desktop Notifications for browser.

Role required: agent

## About this task

**Note:** Notifications play a crucial role in an agent's workflow. However, as browsers continue optimizing resource usage, they may pause or suppress notifications in certain environments or scenarios. To ensure agents receive timely alerts, we recommend thorough testing and adjustments to user settings and behavior. Keep in mind that each browser has its own implementation and restrictions, so what works in one may not work in another.

## Procedure

1.  In your Agent Workspace inbox, select the settings \(\[Omitted image "AgentWorkspaceSettingsIcon.png"\] Alt text: Settings\) icon.

2.  To receive desktop notifications for new items in your inbox, turn on **Inbox Desktop Notifications**.

    These notifications are delivered if the Agent Workspace browser tab is open but not currently in focus.

3.  To receive audible alerts for new items in your inbox, turn on **Inbox Audio Alerts**.

    These alerts are delivered if the Agent Workspace browser tab open, it doesn't matter whether the tab is in focus or in the background.

4.  To receive desktop notifications for new conversations in your inbox, turn on **Conversation Desktop Notifications**.

    These notifications are delivered if the Agent Workspace browser tab is open but not currently in focus.

5.  To receive audible alerts for new chats in your inbox, turn on **Conversation Audio Alerts**.

    These notifications are delivered if the Agent Workspace browser tab is open, it doesn't matter whether the tab is in focus or in the background.

6.  To receive browser notifications, you must have this set-up:

    1.  Chrome as your browser.

    2.  Configured to receive Conversation Desktop Notifications.

    3.  Workspace browser tab is not in focus.

    4.  There is a new message on a conversation assigned to you.
