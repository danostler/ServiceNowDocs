# Configure the card limit for Visual Task boards

Freeform and data driven boards can display up to 1,000 cards by default. You can change the default card limit by adding a system property.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

You can set card limit for both Freeform board and Flexible and Guided board in Data Driven board.

## Procedure

1.  Add a new system property with the following field values:

    |Field|Value|
    |-----|-----|
    |Name|glide.vtb.board\_max|
    |Type|integer|

2.  Set the **Value** to the maximum number of cards allowed for each board.

    **Note:** Performance degradation may occur if you set the **Value** to a number greater than 1,000, especially on tablet devices.
