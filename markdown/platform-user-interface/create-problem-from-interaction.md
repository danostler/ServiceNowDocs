# Create a problem from an interaction

You can create a problem record directly from an Interaction when the customer makes contact regarding an issue and you need to investigate.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: workspace\_user or admin
-   Activate the Problem Management Best Practice — com.snc.best\_practice.problem plugin
-   Select the **Allow Problem creation from Interaction** \(**glide.problem.interaction.allow\_create**\) problem property

**Note:** The Interaction feature is a more efficient way to create a problem from an interaction than the New Call feature from Service Desk Call \(com.snc.service\_desk\_call\) plugin that you might have used previously.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workspace Experience** &gt; **Workspaces** &gt; **Workspace Home**.

2.  Click the list icon \(\[Omitted image "icon-list-view.png"\] Alt text: List icon\) and click the Interaction list.

3.  Click the interaction record from which you want to create a problem.

4.  On the interaction page, click the more actions icon \(\[Omitted image "more-actions-icon.png"\] Alt text: More actions icon\) and select **Create Problem**.

5.  On the form, fill in the fields.
