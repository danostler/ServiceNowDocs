# Configuring the process for reporting medical device issues

You can configure the process for reporting medical device issues from a service portal of your healthcare organization.

**Important:** Healthcare Computerized Maintenance Management System is now deprecated and no longer supported or available for new activation. For details on the deprecation process, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

To use maintenance and servicing workflows or inventory and management workflows, please see [Clinical Device Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/healthcare-life-sciences/clinical-device-mgmt-overview.md).

By default, the users with the sn\_hcls\_cmms.device\_service\_org\_contributor role can create medical device issue cases from a Customer Service Portal page of a healthcare organization. The **Report medical device issue** option is available from the Case menu on the Customer Service Portal page to create medical device issue cases.

As a user with the admin role or contributor, you can use the **Report medical device issue** record producer, which is available by default, or create your own record producer to enable creating medical device issue cases from a service portal. You can include the record producer for creating medical device issue cases in a service  catalog and display the service  catalog  as a module on the service portal page. You can then enable users with the sn\_hcls\_cmms.device\_service\_org\_contributor role to use the module for creating medical device issue cases.

To learn about record producers and service catalogs, see Record Producer and Set up a service catalog.
