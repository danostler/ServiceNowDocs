# Configure the process for creating medical devices included in in-service requests

Use scripted extension points to decide what medical devices are created after an in-service request for a medical device is submitted.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Healthcare Computerized Maintenance Management System is now deprecated and no longer supported or available for new activation. For details on the deprecation process, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

To use maintenance and servicing workflows or inventory and management workflows, please see [Clinical Device Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/healthcare-life-sciences/clinical-device-mgmt-overview.md).

Set the application scope to Healthcare Computerized Maintenance Management System using the application picker. For more information, see [Application picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/application-development/building-applications/c_ApplicationPicker.md).

Role required: admin

## About this task

The Healthcare Computerized Maintenance Management System \(Healthcare CMMS\) application installs the `sn_hcls_cmms.CreateDevicesForOnboardCase` script, the `CreateDevicesForOnboardCase` script include, and the `CreateDevicesForOnboardCase` extension point.

The `sn_hcls_cmms.CreateDevicesForOnboardCase` script is preconfigured to set the medical devices in-service request form available by default within the application. Before creating a medical device in-service request case, the application runs the `sn_hcls_cmms.CreateDevicesForOnboardCase` script and uses the following submission workflow logic to create records and avoid duplication of records:

1.  Create a medical device if the serial number of the device doesn't exist.
2.  Create a medical device model if one doesn't exist or associate the medical device with an existing model as included in the medical device in-service request form.
3.  Create work orders for the initial inspection of medical devices.
4.  Set the state of the devices to **Installed** when the medical device in-service case is set to **Closed complete**.

Using extension points makes it easier to integrate customizations without actually altering the base code. You can extend standard base functionality using customized scripts. For more information, see [Using extension points to extend application functionality](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/api-reference/web-services/extension-points.md).

An implementation is available in the base system for scripted extension points. You can modify the data and add additional fields.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Extension Points** &gt; **Scripted Extension Points**.

2.  In the **API Name** column, search for and click **sn\_hcls\_cmms.CreateDevicesForOnboardCase**.

3.  On the Extension Point form, select a script include to use the `CreateDevicesForOnboardCase` extension point by creating and registering a custom script include.

    You can refer to the CreateDevicesForOnboardCase script include provided with the application to create a custom script include to set the medical device in-service cases. For more information, see [Registering custom script includes against the scripted extension points](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/customer-service-management/impl-scripted-ext-pts-custom-code.md).

4.  Customize the submission workflow logic of your medical device in-service request form by adding the `createDevices`,`checkForDuplicateDevices`, `checkForDuplicateDevicesForNewModel`, `associateToExistingModel`, `createModel`, `createInspectionWorkOrders`, `installDevices`, and `cancelDevices` methods to your script include that implements the `CreateDevicesForOnboardCase` extension point.

    You can create multiple implementations for an extension point and provide an order number for each implementation. The implementation that has the lowest order number is executed first.

Create a medical device only when the selected model contains a device with a unique serial number.

Include the `createDevices` method of the `CreateDevicesForOnboardCase` extension point in the implementation.

When adding a new medical device model, check whether the serial numbers of the medical devices included in the medical device in-service request exist.

Include the `checkForDuplicateDevicesForNewModel` method of the `CreateDevicesForOnboardCase` extension point in the implementation.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Check whether any existing medical device model of the same name, serial number, and manufacturer included in the medical device in-service request exists and associate the model of the medical device with the medical device in-service case.

</td><td>

Include the `associateToExistingModel` method of the `CreateDevicesForOnboardCase` extension point in the implementation.

Create a medical device model with the name, serial number, manufacturer, and description as included in the medical device in-service request and associate the medical device model with the medical device in-service case.
