The Healthcare CMMS data model extends the Healthcare and Life Sciences data model.

The Healthcare CMMS data model uses the Medical device case \[sn\_hcls\_cmms\_case\] table to store medical device cases for medical device in-service, reviewing the AEM request for a medical device model, resolving a medical device issue, or medical device out-of-service.

You can install the Healthcare CMMS application to use its data model.

The Healthcare CMMS data model uses the following tables included within the Healthcare CMMS application to store data.
