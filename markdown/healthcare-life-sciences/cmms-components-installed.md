# Components installed with Healthcare Computerized Maintenance Management System

Several types of components are installed with installation of the Healthcare Computerized Maintenance Management System \(Healthcare CMMS\) application, including tables, user roles, plugins, ServiceNow Store applications, and business rules.

**Important:** Healthcare Computerized Maintenance Management System is now deprecated and no longer supported or available for new activation. For details on the deprecation process, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

To use maintenance and servicing workflows or inventory and management workflows, please see [Clinical Device Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/healthcare-life-sciences/clinical-device-mgmt-overview.md).

Demo data is available for this feature.
