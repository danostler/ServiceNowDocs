# Creating requests for medical devices

Create requests for setting medical devices in-services, reviewing alternative equipment maintenance \(AEM\), resolving medical device issues, or setting medical devices out-of-service from a service portal.

**Important:** Healthcare Computerized Maintenance Management System is now deprecated and no longer supported or available for new activation. For details on the deprecation process, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

To use maintenance and servicing workflows or inventory and management workflows, please see [Clinical Device Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/healthcare-life-sciences/clinical-device-mgmt-overview.md).

Your administrator can configure the option for creating medical device cases based on the service request type for a medical device. The submission form for each request type is configured by your administrator.

As a user with the sn\_hcls\_cmms.device\_service\_org\_contributor role, use the following options available by default from the Case menu on the Customer Service Portal page to place service requests for your medical devices:

-   **Medical device in-service**

    Request to set a medical device in-service and associate the device with a maintenance plan.

-   **Request AEM review**

    Request to review the current maintenance plan changes associated with a medical device model.

-   **Report medical device issue**

    Report medical device issues and request to perform corrective maintenance for resolving them.

-   **Medical device out-of-service**

    Request to set a medical device out-of-service.


After a request is submitted, a corresponding medical device case is created on the associated ServiceNow instance. A clinical engineer then works on the case.
