# Working on a medical device out-of-service case in Workspace

Use the playbook available with the Healthcare Computerized Maintenance Management System \(Healthcare CMMS\) application to manage medical device out-of-service cases and complete requests for setting the medical devices to out-of-service.

**Important:** Healthcare Computerized Maintenance Management System is now deprecated and no longer supported or available for new activation. For details on the deprecation process, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

To use maintenance and servicing workflows or inventory and management workflows, please see [Clinical Device Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/healthcare-life-sciences/clinical-device-mgmt-overview.md).

The playbook experience provides fulfillers with visibility into cross-business workflows and the actionable activities used to complete these workflows. When the playbook experience is activated with Workspace in Healthcare CMMS, the **Playbook** tab appears for a medical device out-of-service case. For more information on how to interact with a playbook, see Interact with Playbook.

As a clinical engineer with the sn\_hcls\_cmms.clinical\_engineer role, you can use the Healthcare CMMS playbook to complete all out-of-service activities for a medical device. You can access the **Playbook** tab on your Workspace when a medical device out-of-service case is assigned to you. The Healthcare CMMS workflow populates the case data for all launched activities on the **Playbook** tab. You can select a stage in the playbook to complete the activities associated with the stage.

By default, the following stages are available to you as a clinical engineer with the sn\_hcls\_cmms.clinical\_engineer role on the **Playbook** tab of the Workspace.

**Note:** The state of the medical device out-of-service case progresses as you complete a stage in the playbook. For more information, see [Life cycle of a medical device out-of-service case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/healthcare-life-sciences/cmms-retire-device-life-cycle.md).

## Completing the initial review activities

In the **Medical device out-of-service** stage of the playbook, complete the following activities:

1.  **Review medical device details**: Review the medical device details for a medical device model and update the details, if needed.

    After the medical device is reviewed and approved, a work order for the initial inspection for each device included in the model is created automatically.

2.  **Cancel work orders**: Review and cancel the work orders for each medical devices.
3.  **Set medical device out-of-service**: Set the medical device to out-of-service.
4.  **Disposal work order**: Create a disposal work order for the out-of-service device.

## Closing the out-of-service request

In the **Review and confirm** stage of the playbook, complete the **Close case** activity by waiting until all other activities are completed, and then selecting a resolution code and adding any resolution notes.
