# Life cycle of a medical device out-of-service case

Medical device out-of-service cases within the Healthcare Computerized Maintenance Management System \(Healthcare CMMS\) application can be in one of the several states as it progresses through the fulfillment cycle.

**Important:** Starting with the Xanadu release, Healthcare Computerized Maintenance Management System is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer activated on new instances but will continue to be supported.
