# Working on a medical device in-service case in Workspace

Use the playbook available with the Healthcare Computerized Maintenance Management System \(Healthcare CMMS\) application to manage medical device in-service cases and complete requests to set the medical devices in-service.

**Important:** Healthcare Computerized Maintenance Management System is now deprecated and no longer supported or available for new activation. For details on the deprecation process, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

To use maintenance and servicing workflows or inventory and management workflows, please see [Clinical Device Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/healthcare-life-sciences/clinical-device-mgmt-overview.md).

The playbook experience provides fulfillers with visibility into cross-business workflows and the actionable activities used to complete these workflows. When the playbook experience is activated with Workspace in Healthcare CMMS, the **Playbook** tab appears for a medical device in-service case. For more information on how to interact with a playbook, see Interact with Playbook.

As a clinical engineer with the sn\_hcls\_cmms.clinical\_engineer role, you can use the Healthcare CMMS playbook to complete all medical device in-service activities for a medical device. You can access the **Playbook** tab on your Workspace when a medical device in-service case is assigned to you. The Healthcare CMMS workflow populates the case data for all launched activities on the **Playbook** tab. You can select a stage in the playbook to complete the activities associated with the stage.

By default, the following stages are available to you as a clinical engineer with the sn\_hcls\_cmms.clinical\_engineer role on the **Playbook** tab of the Workspace.

</table>**Note:** The state of the medical device in-service case progresses as you complete a stage in the playbook. For more information, see [Life cycle of a medical device in-service case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/healthcare-life-sciences/cmms-cd-ob-life-cycle.md).

## Reviewing the medical device model

In the **Medical device model intake** stage of the playbook, complete the **Review model** activity by reviewing the name, number, and manufacturer details including the short description entered for a medical device model included within an medical device in-service request and modify the details, if needed.

**Note:** If there’s no new model required for the medical device, the **Medical device model intake** stage doesn't appear in the playbook.

## Managing maintenance plans

In the **Maintenance plan intake** stage of the playbook, complete the **Manage maintenance plans** activity by managing maintenance plans and schedules for the medical device. You can create a new maintenance plan by clicking **Add plan** and creating a work plan from the Work Plan page.

In the new Work Plan page, the required conditions and set conditions are automatically populated.

**Note:** If there’s no new model required for the medical device, the **Maintenance plan intake** stage doesn't appear in the playbook.

## Completing the medical device intake activities

In the **Medical device intake** stage of the playbook, complete the following activities:

1.  **Review devices**: Review the medical devices included within a medical device model and edit their details, if needed. You also evaluate the risks for a medical device. When the risk assessment is completed, the risk score is displayed for the device. For more information, see [Assess the risks when setting a medical device in-service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/healthcare-life-sciences/cmms-assess-risk-ob-cd.md).

    After the medical device is reviewed, a work order for the initial inspection for each device included in the model is created automatically.

2.  **Review work orders**: Mark this step as complete when a technician completes the work order associated with the device. You can also view all work orders associated with the medical device model or create another work order by clicking **View all**.

## Reviewing maintenance plans

In the **Maintenance plans** stage of the playbook, review the schedule of the maintenance plan for the device that is automatically populated from the medical device model.

## Closing the medical device in-service request

In the **Review and confirm** stage of the playbook, complete the **Close case** activity by waiting until all other activities are completed, and then selecting a resolution code and adding any resolution notes.

**Note:** After the state of the medical device in-service case is set to **Closed complete**, the state of the medical device is automatically set to **Installed**.
