# Configure Core Business Suite applications

Configure Core Business Suite applications by running scheduled jobs that initialize all required workflows and apply settings.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Assign the CBS requester role to all the active employees in the system by running the **CBS - Add Requestor Role to Users** scheduled job.

    **Note:** Run this scheduled job once during the initial Core Business Suite setup. You do not need to run it again after installing Core Business Suite applications.

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Definition** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

    2.  Search for and select **CBS - Add Requestor Role to Users**.

    3.  On the CBS - Add Requestor Role to Users page, select **Execute Now**.

2.  Activate Core Business Suite records by running the **Update service records for the Core Business Suite** scheduled job.

    Core Business Suite records include:

    -   EC Portal notifications
    -   Workspace notifications
    -   Email notifications
