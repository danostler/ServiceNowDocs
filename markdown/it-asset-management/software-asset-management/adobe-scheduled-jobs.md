# Scheduled jobs for Adobe

Your Adobe integration profile is set to fetch subscription and usage information automatically from the Adobe portal on a scheduled basis. If needed, you can also run the following scheduled jobs manually to get this information. Each job must be complete before starting the next one.

|Scheduled job|Run frequency|Description|
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
|SAM - Import Adobe User Subscriptions|Weekly|Imports and updates the Adobe Cloud application subscription data into the Software Asset Management application from the Adobe Admin Console.
