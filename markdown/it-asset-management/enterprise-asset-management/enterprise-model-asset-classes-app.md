# Expanded Model and Asset Classes Store application

The Expanded Model and Asset Classes Store application adds model and asset classes that extend out-of-the-box classes within the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) class hierarchy. These extensions include class descriptions, identification rules, identifier entries, and dependent relationships. The application also adds model categories and API categories.

**Note:** This application is compatible with the Rome and later family releases.

For more information on the CMDB, see Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\).

In addition to extending CMDB model and asset classes, the Expanded Model and Asset Classes application creates model categories that associate model and asset classes with CMDB configuration item \(CI\) classes. The Enterprise Asset Management application uses these classes and model categories to create asset and model records that can be used to track and manage enterprise assets. Discovery tools, such as the ServiceNow® Discovery application, can also use these classes and model categories to create asset and model records for discovered CIs. See [Model categories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/model-hierarchy.md) for more information on model categories.

The Expanded Model and Asset Classes application also adds the API and Managed API model categories, which allow the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) application to create and associate application models with API and Managed API CMDB CI classes. API CMDB CI classes provide classifications for APIs \(application programming interfaces\), which are sets of definitions and protocols that enable computer programs to communicate with each other. Managed API CMDB CI classes provide classifications for APIs that are discovered through gateways or management services, such as Amazon API Gateway. By associating application models with these CMDB CI classes, the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) application can create version-agnostic representations of your APIs. These representations can then provide a more holistic view of each API during reporting and analysis. For more information on API and Managed API CMDB CI classes, see .

## Enterprise model classes added by the application

The Expanded Model and Asset Classes application adds the Enterprise good model \[sn\_ent\_model\] class, Firmware model \[sn\_ent\_firmware\_model\] class, and Discovered firmware model \[sn\_ent\_discov\_firmware\_model\] class, which extend the base Product model \[cmdb\_model\] class. The Enterprise good model \[sn\_ent\_model\] class includes classifications for various enterprise model types, which are categorized into the following industry-based child classes:\[Omitted image "enterprise-model-classes-hierarchy.png"\] Alt text: Enterprise good model classes hierarchy.

<table id="table_o2v_sy5_25b"><thead><tr><th>

Enterprise good model child class

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Medical model\[sn\_ent\_medical\_model\]

</td><td>

Classifies medical-based enterprise models, such as ER Medical Cart Kit and ECG Electrodes.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Medical device model\[sn\_ent\_medical\_device\_model\]

</td><td>

Classifies medical device-based enterprise models, such as Blood Pressure Monitor and MRI Patient Table.**Note:** When you upgrade to version 1.2.0 or later of the Expanded Model and Asset Classes application, the application automatically runs the `Update medical device category` fix script to associate the Medical Device model \[sn\_ent\_medical\_device\_model\] class with the existing Medical device model category. However, you may need to manually reclassify existing enterprise models under the Medical device model category from the Medical model \[sn\_ent\_medical\_model\] class to the Medical Device model \[sn\_ent\_medical\_device\_model\] class. Refer to [KB1182183](https://support.servicenow.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fkb%3Fid%3Dkb_article_view%26sysparm_article%3DKB1182183) for detailed instructions.

Product Instance Identifier \(PID\) which is a unique and common identifier that links the asset, CI, and IBI classes is generated for the assets of Medical Device model category. PID is generated based on the PID configurations applicable for the Medical Device model category.

The Product Instance Identifier Configurations \[product\_instance\_identifier\_configuration\] table stores the PID configurations. By default, the following configurations are available:

-   **PID - Serial number** that includes a parameter defined based on the Serial number field of the Asset \[alm\_asset\] table.
-   **PID - Parent** that includes parameters defined based on the Parent and Model Component ID fields of the Asset \[alm\_asset\] table.

When many PID configurations are associated with the Medical Device model category, the configuration with the highest priority is considered first during the generation of the PID. The PID - Serial number configuration is mostly given the highest priority.

</table>**Important:** In the Zurich release, the Classification \(classification\) column in the Enterprise good model \[sn\_ent\_model\] table has been deprecated and renamed as Classification \(deprecated\). The data from this column is available in the new Classification \(classification\_code\) column in the Product model \[cmdb\_model\] table.

Reports in the Enterprise Asset Workspace that previously referred to the Classification column in the Enterprise good model table now reference the new Classification \(classification\_code\) column in the Product model table.
