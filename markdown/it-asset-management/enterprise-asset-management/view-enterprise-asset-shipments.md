# View and add enterprise asset shipments

Use the Shipments list to view all active enterprise asset shipments from a central location. If an existing shipment doesn’t appear on the list, you can add it manually.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_technician, sn\_eam.enterprise\_asset\_manager, or sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin

**Note:** Only the sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin role can add shipments manually.

## About this task

You can view and add shipments for your transfer orders, purchase orders, move orders, Return Merchandise Authorization \(RMA\) orders, disposal orders, resale orders, recall orders, reclamation requests, Advanced Shipment Notifications \(ASNs\), and lease contracts.

**Important:** When using the Sourcing and Procurement Operations application with the Asset Management Integration for Sourcing and Procurement Operations \(com.snc.sn\_spend\_asset\) installed, the IT Asset Management application shares shipment details with the Sourcing and Procurement Operations application. To enable the Sourcing and Procurement Operations application to view shipment and tracking numbers associated with Purchase Orders, read-only access has been provided to the Shipment \[sn\_itam\_common\_shipment\] and Shipment line \[sn\_itam\_common\_m2m\_shipment\_asset\] table.

For more information about the Asset Management Integration for Sourcing and Procurement Operations \(com.snc.sn\_spend\_asset\) plugin, see .
