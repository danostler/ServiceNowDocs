# Perform condition evaluation from the Enterprise Asset Workspace

Perform condition evaluation to calculate the score and result of the condition attributes from the Enterprise Asset Workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_eam.asset\_technician

## About this task

These steps detail the process of performing the condition evaluation from the Enterprise Asset Workspace. Condition evaluation can also be performed from the Mobile application. For details, see [Perform condition evaluation from the Mobile Agent application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/it-asset-management/enterprise-asset-management/perform-condition-assessment-mobileapp.md).

**Note:** Starting with Enterprise Asset Management version 10.0, a work order can be associated with more than one asset or an asset group.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Enterprise Asset Workspace** &gt; **Work management** &gt; **Work order tasks**.

2.  Select the condition work task assigned to you.

3.  Select **Accept** and then select **Start work**.

    The status of the work order task changes to **Work in Progress**

4.  Select the **Condition lines** tab.

    In Enterprise Asset Management version 10.0 and later, the Condition lines related list displays condition lines for all assets in the Affected assets list. A condition evaluation is created for each asset, and you must complete all condition lines to complete and close the task.

5.  Select the condition evaluation for the condition line that you want to assess.

6.  Enter a value for the questions in the sections.

7.  Select **Submit**.

8.  In the confirmation box, select **Submit**.

    After you submit the condition evaluation, refresh the **Condition lines** page to view the score and result for the condition line.

9.  In Enterprise Asset Management version 10.0 and later, repeat steps 5 through 8 for each condition line in the **Condition lines** tab.

10. Select **Close Complete** in the Condition work task page.

    The Enterprise asset manager can review the asset condition results and view the reports in the Work management dashboard.
