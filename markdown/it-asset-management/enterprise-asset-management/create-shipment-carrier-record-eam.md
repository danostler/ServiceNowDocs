# Create a shipment carrier record in Enterprise Asset Workspace

Create a shipping carrier record in the Enterprise Asset Workspace to associate the carrier with an integration profile.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_eam.enterprise\_admin

## About this task

Create a shipping carrier record used to associate the carrier with an integration profile.

**Important:** When using the Sourcing and Procurement Operations application with the Asset Management Integration for Sourcing and Procurement Operations \(com.snc.sn\_spend\_asset\) installed, the IT Asset Management application shares shipment details with the Sourcing and Procurement Operations application. To enable the Sourcing and Procurement Operations application to view shipment and tracking numbers associated with Purchase Orders, read-only access has been provided to the Shipping carrier \[sn\_itam\_common\_shipping\_carrier\] table.

For more information about the Asset Management Integration for Sourcing and Procurement Operations \(com.snc.sn\_spend\_asset\) plugin, see .
