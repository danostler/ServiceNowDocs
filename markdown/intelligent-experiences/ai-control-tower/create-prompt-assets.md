# Create prompt assets

Create AI assets to track and manage the life cycles of your prompts.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ai\_governance\_ai\_steward or sn\_ai\_asset\_mgmt.ai\_asset\_owner

## About this task

A prompt is the instructive input that you provide to AI models to elicit specific responses or outputs. The more detailed and descriptive a prompt is, the higher the quality of the response or output. Examples of prompts include instructions, questions, and commands.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **AI Control Tower**.

2.  From the AI Control Tower, open the AI assets view.

3.  From the navigation menu of the AI assets view, navigate toeither **AI asset inventory - Managed** &gt; **Prompts**or **AI asset inventory - Unmanaged** &gt; **Prompts**.

4.  Select **Add prompt**.

5.  In the Details section of the Add prompt form, fill in the fields.

</table>6.  Select **Next**.

7.  In the Related assets section of the Add prompt form, associate the prompt with related AI models.

    Related AI models include any AI models that you can provide the prompt to. These AI models can process inputs from the prompt and help generate appropriate outputs.

    Depending on if the related AI model is currently available in your asset inventory, proceed with one of the following options:

    -   To associate the prompt with a related AI model that is currently available, use the following steps:

        1.  Select the Add from inventory drop-down menu on the header of the AI models list.
        2.  Select **Add from inventory**.
        3.  In the Add from inventory dialog box, select the check box for the related AI model that you want to associate the prompt with.

            **Note:** If you want to associate the prompt with multiple related AI models, select the check box for each model.

        4.  Select **Add**.
        The dialog box closes and the selected AI model appears in the AI models list.

    -   To associate the prompt with a related AI model that is not currently available, use the following steps:

        1.  Select the Add from inventory drop-down menu on the header of the AI models list.
        2.  Select **Create**.
        3.  Create the AI model by following the proceeding steps in [Create AI model assets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/create-ai-model-assets.md).
        The new AI model appears in the AI models list.

8.  Select **Submit for review**.

    **Note:** If you aren’t ready to submit the prompt for review, select **Save** instead. You can then edit it and submit it for review later by navigating to **AI assets** &gt; **Lifecycle** &gt; **Onboard** and then selecting the prompt from the list. When the AI asset record opens, continue editing the prompt details.


## Result

The prompt is added to your AI asset inventory. It automatically enters the onboard stage of the AI asset life cycle and is updated with a Lifecycle status of AI steward review.

## What to do next

Users who are assigned the AI steward \(sn\_ai\_governance.ai\_steward\) role can start the review process to begin tracking and managing the life cycle of the prompt.
