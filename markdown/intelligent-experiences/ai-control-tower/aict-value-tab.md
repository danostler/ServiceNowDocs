# Value tab in AI Control Tower

Use the Value dashboard page to gain insights into the value realized from multiple types of AI systems, view data about user engagement and feed₹back, and adoption of every type of AI system in your organization.

The Value dashboard page contains visualizations that help you assess the value of your AI systems. Creator skills are included in the Value dashboard page. Value metrics for creator skills are aggregated across non-production and production instances. You need to have the AI steward role to view this dashboard.

**Note:** Starting with the March 2026 release, the Value dashboard displays insights and value calculations only for managed AI assets within your selected time period. To view insights for unmanaged assets, you must reconfigure them as managed assets. For AI assets that were previously managed and later reconfigured as unmanaged, the system calculates values only through the date of their status change to unmanaged.

The indicators on the dashboard are based on the value templates associated with each AI system. See [Using value templates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/intelligent-experiences/ai-control-tower/using-value-templates.md) for more information.
