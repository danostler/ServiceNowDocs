Instance

</td><td>

The instance where the value template is applied. This field is useful for managing value templates across instances.**Note:** You can validate a formula in a non-production instance before publishing it to a production instance. After initiating testing for a value template, you might need to wait up to 10 minutes for same-instance testing or 30 minutes for cross-instance testing. During this time, you can't edit or resend the template for testing, but you can continue working with other templates.
