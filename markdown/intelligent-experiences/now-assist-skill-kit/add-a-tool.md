# Add a tool

Add and manage tools visually in the Tools editor, including decision branching, to execute different tools for your skill. Adding decision branches between tools enables you to define the conditions that need to be met for a tool to run. If no conditions are met, the default branch's step is executed.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_skill\_builder.admin

## About this task

A tool is a utility that is configured to convert skill inputs into skill outputs. The tool outputs can be referenced in a prompt template to introduce context to a prompt. The input for a tool can be a skill input or the output of another tool.

You can use the Tool editor to configure tools and link them to each other.

Decision nodes enable you to execute different tools, based on the logic of the branch. A decision node can contain multiple branches but will always need one default branch.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Assist Skill Kit** &gt; **Home**.

2.  Select the skill you want to add a tool to.

3.  Select the **Tool editor** tab.

4.  Select \(+\) icon to add a node.

5.  Select the type of node that you want to add.

 Types of tool:

-   Script
-   SubFlow
-   Flow Action
-   Retriever
-   Skill
-   Web search

**Note:** If you select Google as your web search tool provider, the web search tool leverages [Grounding with Google Search](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/grounding/grounding-with-google-search), offered under a Global Standard deployment. Because grounding is not [data resident](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/security-controls), Google's global infrastructure routes traffic to a global data center for each web search request. This processing may be different than your data processing location chosen for your ServiceNow instance. Please consider your organization's data policies before enabling skills that have Google web search tools.
