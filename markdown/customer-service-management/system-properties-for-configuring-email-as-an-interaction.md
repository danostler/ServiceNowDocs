# System properties for configuring Email Interaction

You can manage certain workflows based on the system properties, such as enabling or disabling the creation of email interactions for guest users. You can set an inactivity period after which email interactions are automatically closed.

Navigate to **All****&gt;System Properties****&gt;All Properties** .

Alternatively, in your instance, enter `sys_properties.list` in the filter navigator and customize the Email Interaction system properties.
