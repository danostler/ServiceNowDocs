# Email Interaction record page

The Email interaction record page enables customer service agents to work on incoming emails as interactions, similar to the chat and voice interaction record pages.

Email interactions help client support teams triage and obtain proper approvals before proceeding with any work on an account. Email interactions act as a staging record before agents create cases for additional work.
