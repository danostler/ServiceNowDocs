# Activate Customer Data Models for B2B2C

You can activate the Customer Data Models for B2B2C plugin \(com.sn\_csm\_b2b\_consumers\) if you have the admin role. The application includes demo data and installs related ServiceNow® Store applications and plugins if they aren’t already installed.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

You must activate the Customer Service Install Base Management \(com.snc.install\_base\) plugin before installing Customer Data Models for B2B2C.

The Customer Data Models for B2B2C plugin provides the following roles:

-   Account consumer \(sn\_acct\_consumer.consumer\)
-   Account consumer agent \(sn\_acct\_consumer.agent\)

When the plugin is activated, customer service agents inherit the account consumer agent role. Consumers who are added as account consumers are given the account consumer role.

## About this task

The following items are installed with Customer Data Models for B2B2C:

-   Business rules: Required account or consumer
-   UI policies
    -   Table: Case
    -   Table: Interaction
    -   Table: Sold Product

2.  Find the Customer Data Models for B2B2C plugin \(com.sn\_csm\_b2b\_consumers\) using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.
