# Interaction Controls Component

Interaction Controls Component \(ICC\) is a component that allows for a native call controls interface embedded in Agent Workspace.

-   Create state context in OpenFrame to read the state of idle and active call state
-   Create the state context in OpenFrame to read the state of transfer
-   Provide iframe sandbox parameters to allow iframe access to security features and to enable additional iframe restrictions
-   Create an extension point implementation to hide the conversation panel when real-time transcription is turned on/off
-   Create an extension point implementation to create and get phone log segments
-   Implement Click to Dial on CSM Workspace with ICC enabled
-   Seismic event emitted to the Polaris shell via Active call component when any action clicked related to the transfer component
-   Screen pop for Interaction should be available on Dialpad and Click-to-call outbound call
-   sn\_openframe.create\_interaction will be ignored when using ICC. All inbound and outbound calls will have interactions created.
