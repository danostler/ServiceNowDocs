# Customer contact self-registration

The self-registration feature enables new customer contacts to submit registration requests through the customer portal.

A customer contact can submit a registration request using a valid registration code. The request is then sent to the customer administrator of that account for approval. For details, see [Approve a change request, or registration request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/customer-service-management/approve-request-from-cust-portal.md).

If an account has multiple customer administrators, they all receive the registration request, but only one approval is necessary.

The request is either accepted or rejected. If accepted, a new account is created, and the customer contact gets an email with a user ID and a temporary password. When logging in to the portal for the first time, the customer contact needs to change the temporary password. If rejected, the customer contact gets an email notification.

**Note:** If a request is submitted with an incorrect registration code, a notification message appears `Invalid Registration Code`.

The administrator creates a unique registration code for each account and stores it in the **Registration Code** field on the Account form. After the code is created, customer administrators can distribute the code to customers as needed.
