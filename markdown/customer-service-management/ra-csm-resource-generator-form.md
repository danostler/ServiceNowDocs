# Resource generator inputs form

The form provides information about the generator type and generator inputs.

## Resource Generators form fields

The Task Intelligence Admin Console \(com.sn\_ti\_admin\) plugin must be installed for selecting the Task Intelligence Classification resource generator type.

**Note:**

-   You can enter static values for the generator input fields. If the **Generator type** is Flow or Decision table, you can use the pill picker to select dynamic values. The context record is available for selection in the pill picker.
-   If the context inputs are defined for a context, they appear in the pill picker for selection. The context inputs are supported for Flow and Decision table generator types only.
