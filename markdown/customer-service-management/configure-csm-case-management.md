# Configure case management

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The customer service case is the primary entity of the customer service application. An agent creates a case to identify a customer's question or issue and to track the activities related to resolving the issue. An agent also uses a case to track all communication with the customer, including the communication channels used.

Case activities include any action that is taken to resolve an issue. These actions can include phone calls or emails, knowledge base research, conversations with subject matter experts, and dispatch requests to field service agents, as well as other activities.

From the case form, an agent can store related information such as the customer's name, contact details, company, account, product and asset information, service contract, entitlement details, and any associated SLAs.

**Note:** These steps also apply to case type configuration.

To configure case management, use the Customer Service-guided setup. The guided setup takes you through the entire setup and configuration process.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Guided Setup**.

2.  On the Getting Started page of the guided setup, select **Get Started**.

3.  In the Case Management category, view the list of tasks to configure the feature.
