# Notifications for agent mentions in records

Agents collaborating on records may need to notify teammates about specific updates or actions. By using the at key \(@\) to mention another agent in a comment, work note, or supported text field, the system automatically sends a workspace notification to the mentioned agent. This helps promote timely awareness and response without relying on separate communication channels.

## About the feature

When an agent is mentioned using the at key \(@\), the system automatically sends a workspace notification to the mentioned agent. The notification includes a header and a message:

-   The header contains:
    -   The name of the agent who mentioned them.
    -   The record ID and type.
-   The message contains:
    -   The short description, subject, or problem statement of the record.
    -   A direct link to the record.

Notification format: "You have been mentioned by \[Name\] in the \[Table Name\] record \[Record ID\]."

## Key capabilities

-   Supports mention across multiple record types.
-   Sends individual notifications to each mentioned agent, even when multiple agents are tagged in one comment.
-   Enables agents to configure notification preferences and set "Do Not Disturb" hours.
-   Redirects agents only to records that they can access.
