# Using Interaction Controls Component \(ICC\) call controls with Amazon Connect

Agents can access the Active call controls directly from their CSM Configurable Workspace to manage phone interactions. This reduces context switching, improves productivity with Amazon Connect.

## Amazon Connect for voice calls overview

Amazon Connect integration with ICC provides voice controls enabling agents to handle phone interactions without leaving their Workspace. Call features include actions such as answering, holding, transferring, muting, ending, and accessing the phone directory. Real-time synchronization of agent presence, compliance, and support for various call management features are key achievements of this integration.

To use this feature, complete the steps in the **Enable Interaction Controls** section of the Amazon Connect guided setup for configuring the components. See 

## Key Features and Benefits of the Amazon Connect integration

-   **Call controls:**

    Agents can answer, hold, transfer, mute, and end calls directly within their ServiceNow Workspace.

-   **Real-time agent presence updates:**

    Agent status in Amazon Connect, is automatically updated in real-time based on Workspace status change. Amazon Connect status change by system or supervisor reflects in real-time in the agent Workspace.

-   **Access to the phone directory for dialing calls:**

    Agents can use the phone directory to search for customers to make outbound calls. They can also use it on an active call to search for internal agents to transfer customer calls via Consult or Blind transfer.


An agent performs the following key actions within their Workspace:

## Log in to Amazon Connect

Log in to Amazon Connect and set your status to 'Available', within your Workspace. You’re now available and ready to receive inbound customer calls.

## State presence

Your presence status synchronizes with Amazon Connect. Any change in your status due to system events or supervisor actions is reflected in real-time within your inbox verifying that your availability is updated.

**Note:** Presence states values configured must match between ServiceNow and Amazon Connect to ensure bi-directional synchronization.

## Receiving and accepting inbound calls

Use the inbox Alert Card to accept or reject calls. Manage calls via actions such as hold, transfer, mute, or access the transfer target list to transfer calls to other agents or queues. If you’re away from your Workspace, the alert times out and sets you in the 'Missed call' status. Change your status back to 'Available' to continue receiving calls. Additionally, you can open or close the phone keypad during an active call.

## After Call Work \(ACW\)

After Call Work \(ACW\) refers to the tasks agents complete after finishing a call. It can include documenting the conversation details, updating customer records, or following up on unresolved issues. When you hang up a call, Amazon will put the agent state into ACW. The Agent must change their status from ACW to Available to start getting new calls. To enable the agent to go immediately into the Available state after disconnecting a call, the Amazon Connect admin can set ACW to zero.

## Initiating outbound calls

Make outbound calls by using the keypad, phone directory, or click-to-call. An outbound call creates an Interaction record that displays in the agent’s Workspace displaying the call details.

## Transferring a call to an agent or queue

Access the transfer target list with the Active call window to transfer calls to other agents or queues by searching for an agent or queue. Select the contact and begin transferring the call to other agents via Consult or Blind transfer.

When the second agent accepts the call, the first agent can either end the call or continue to stay in the call. If the first agent ends the call after transferring it to the second agent, the call Interaction is ready for wrap-up.
