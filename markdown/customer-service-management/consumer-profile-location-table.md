# Consumer Profile Location table

The Consumer Profile Location \[sn\_csm\_consumer\_profile\_location\] table stores the relationship between the consumer profiles and locations.

Starting with the Vancouver release, the Consumer Profile Location \[sn\_csm\_consumer\_profile\_location\] table was introduced. By using this table, you can enhance your consumer profiles to support multiple addresses. Adding this functionality enables the relationship between the consumer profiles and locations, which enables various industries to manage multiple addresses for the individual profiles.
