# Synchronizing the Install base life cycle fields with the state and status fields

You can synchronize the **Life cycle stage** field and the **Life cycle stage status** fields with the **State** and **Status** fields on the Install base form so that you can track the life-cycle of an Install base entity.

## Overview of life cycle mapping

Track the life cycle of an Install base entity by migrating to the Common Service Data Model. To learn more about the CSDM framework, see [Common Service Data Model framework for Install Base Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/customer-service-management/csdm-framework-for-install-base-management.md).

## Life-cycle Mapping table

The life-cycle Mapping \[life\_cycle\_mapping\] table is already populated with the life cycle mapping values and choices that you must begin your synchronization of the **Life cycle stage** field and the **Life cycle stage status** fields with the **State** and **Status** fields on the Install base form. The mapping record maps the **State** fields with their corresponding life cycle fields on the Install base form. The **In Use** and **InActive** options are available in the **State** field and their corresponding mappings are available in the life-cycle Mapping \[life\_cycle\_mapping\] table. With these default options, you can initiate a synchronization with the life cycle fields.

Add a mapping record in the life-cycle Mapping \[life\_cycle\_mapping\] table to create custom choices for the **State** and **Status** fields. Each custom value has related records on the life-cycle Mapping \[life\_cycle\_mapping\] table. You must enable the mapping records for the synchronization to begin.

For information on how to create the custom choices and then map the **Life cycle stage** and **Life cycle stage status** fields with the legacy **State** field, see [Enabling life-cycle sync from legacy-to-asset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/servicenow-platform/common-service-data-model-csdm/csdm-life-cycle-standard-values.md).

**Note:** If the custom choices have no life cycle mappings, then the **Life cycle stage** and the **Life cycle stage status** fields remain in the **To Be Determined** state.

## Migration of the Install base table

To not activate all the tables and records in the CSDM framework, you can migrate only the Install Base table \(sn\_install\_base\_item\) as a part of your CSDM migration process. Use the following script to migrate the existing records to synchronize the legacy **State** field with the Install base life-cycle fields.

```
var tableNames = [];//list of tablenames ex: ['sn_install_base_item'];
new sn_install_base.IBProductInstanceUtil(). syncLifeCycleFields(tableNames);
```
