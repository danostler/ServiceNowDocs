# Auto-dismiss alerts in CSM Configurable Workspace

In CSM Configurable Workspace, you can configure certain alerts to automatically disappear after a set time. This helps reduce alert fatigue and helps agents stay focused by reducing the need to manually dismiss lower-priority alerts.

Admins can configure auto-dismiss alert behavior at the experience level either using UI Builder or UX Page Properties. This configuration provides control over timer duration and display options. Agents view alerts based on the configuration created by the admin.

Role required: admin

You can either configure this feature using UI Builder or UX Page Properties, depending on your preference.

**Configuring using UI Builder**:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework ** &gt; **UI Builder**.
2.  Select the **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace** experience.
3.  In the top-right corner, select **View experience settings**.
4.  Scroll to the Configurable alerts section.
5.  For each desired alert level, enable the check box under **Auto-dismiss**.
6.  In the **Timeout \(seconds\)** column, enter the duration for which the alert should remain visible. The default is 5 seconds.
7.  Configure the following display options.
    -   **Show time label**: Shows a countdown timer on the alert. This option is enabled by default.
    -   **Expand alert content by default**: Automatically expands the alert content when it appears.
8.  Select **Save**.

**Configuring using UX Page Properties**:

1.  Navigate to the UX Page Properties list by entering `sys_ux_page_property.list` in the application navigator.
