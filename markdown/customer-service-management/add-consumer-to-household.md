# Add consumers to a household

Add consumers as members of a household.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_customerservice\_manager, admin

## About this task

You can add existing consumers from the Consumer table to a household.

-   A household can have multiple consumers.
-   A consumer can belong to multiple households. One household can be designated as the primary household for that consumer.

Household member records are added to the Household Member table. When a consumer is added to a household, the consumer is assigned a unique household member number that begins with the prefix HM.

The Household form includes the following related lists for household members:

-   Current Members: consumers that belong to the household as of the current date.
-   All Members: current members and past members. The customer service manager or admin can indicate that a consumer no longer belongs to the household by adding a date to the **End Date** field. A consumer that has left a household can be added back to that household.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Customer Service** &gt; **Customer** &gt; **Households**.

2.  Select a household.

3.  In the Current Members related list, click **New**.

4.  Add a user from the Consumer table in the **Consumer** field.

    The **Household** field is automatically updated with the household selected in step 2.

5.  If desired, add the date that the consumer was added to the household in the **Start Date** field

    The **End Date** field can be added if the consumer is removed from the household.

6.  Click **Submit**.

    The consumer is added to the Current Members related list.

    On the Consumer form for this consumer, the household is added to the following related lists:

    -   Current Households
    -   All Households
    **Note:** You may need to configure the Consumer form to display these related lists.
