# Use Business Application Lifecycle Management to request a digital integration

Submit a request using the Application Lifecycle Management module to request a digital integration in Enterprise Architecture \(formerly Application Portfolio Management\).

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_apm.apm\_user

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Enterprise Architecture** &gt; **Business Application Lifecycle Management** &gt; **Business Application Catalog**.

    The Business Application Lifecycle Management Services opens in a service catalog page.

2.  Register a new digital integration by selecting the **Request a Digital Integration** card or selecting **View Details** in the Request Digital Integration card.

3.  On the Request a Digital Integration form, fill in the fields.

    For a description of the field values, see [Request digital integration form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-portfolio-management/request-digital-integration-form.md).

4.  Select **Submit**.


## Result

The system validates your request to check if a digital integration with the same name exists. If yes, then an error message is displayed. If no, then a flow is triggered and a request to register a digital integration is created.

After your request is approved, the requested digital integration is created as a record in the digital integrations table.
