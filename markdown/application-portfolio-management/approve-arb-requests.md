# Approve architecture review requests - Legacy

You can approve an architecture review request if you are part of the Enterprise Architect Group.

## Before you begin

**Important:**

Starting with the Xanadu release, the legacy business applications module is moved to the Enterprise Architecture Workspace. To learn more, see [Managing requests, certifications, and assessments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-portfolio-management/manage-requests-certs-assessments.md).

Role required: sn\_apm.apm\_analyst

## About this task

An approver in the group need not necessarily be an Enterprise Architecture user nor have an Enterprise Architecture role. However, the approver must be a user listed in the user table \[sys\_user\]. Any approver from the Enterprise Architect Group can approve the architecture review request.

To add or modify the members in the group, navigate to **All** &gt; **Enterprise Architecture** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Services Approval Group**.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Enterprise Architecture** &gt; **Business Application Lifecycle Management** &gt; **Service Requests**.

2.  Click the task number.

3.  Scroll down to the Approvers related list and click the state of the approval.

4.  Select **Approved** or **Rejected** in the **State** field.

5.  Click **Update**.

    The requester receives an email notification once you approve or reject an ARB request. An automated flow designer process is also created. You can navigate to **All** &gt; **Enterprise Architecture** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Services Flow Designer** to see the flow.
