description: In the Enterprise Architecture Workspace, enterprise architects can manage certifications alongside requests, assessments, and portfolio health insights without switching to separate modules. You can define rules for validating data \(for example, application lifecycle, technology standards\), automate recurring checks \(daily, monthly, quarterly\), assign certifiers to review and approve data. You can highlight overdue certifications and compliance gaps.

# Working with data certification

In the Enterprise Architecture Workspace, enterprise architects can manage certifications alongside requests, assessments, and portfolio health insights without switching to separate modules. You can define rules for validating data \(for example, application lifecycle, technology standards\), automate recurring checks \(daily, monthly, quarterly\), assign certifiers to review and approve data. You can highlight overdue certifications and compliance gaps.
