# Use Business Application Lifecycle Management to request an architecture review - Legacy

You can request a review of your new architecture design proposal on the technology of a business application by presenting it to the architecture review board.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_apm.apm\_user

## About this task

As an application owner you can propose a modification to the underlying technology of a business application, modification to network design, or propose a new service, solution, or hardware standard.

Your design proposal is reviewed by a team of enterprise architects forming an Architecture Review Board with goals to:

-   Align development with IT strategies.
-   Improve the product quality through the design review process.
-   Provide guidance on recommended practices for specific design questions.
-   Act as a referral team for security, performance, UI design to review upcoming features that may be impacted.

Architecture review requests are routed through the Business Application Lifecycle Management workflow to the configured Architecture Review Board \(ARB\). To process requests, your organization must define an ARB approval group and associate it with the architecture review workflow. If requests do not progress after submission, verify that the ARB group and approval configuration are set up by an Enterprise Architecture administrator.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Enterprise Architecture** &gt; **Business Application Lifecycle Management** &gt; **Business Application Catalog**.

2.  Click the **Request Architecture Review** link or **View Details** in the Request Architecture Review card to request an architecture review.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    Name of the business application is mandatory. Mandatory fields have a red asterisk \(\*\) beside them.

    **Note:**

    You must be the business owner, IT Application owner, or one who supports the application to request an architecture review.

    For field information, see [Request Architecture Review form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-portfolio-management/request-architecture-review-form.md).

4.  Click **Submit**.

    On submission, an approval request is sent to the members of the Enterprise Architect Group. An email notification is sent to you as soon as your request is approved by the review board. You shall be notified even if your request is rejected.
