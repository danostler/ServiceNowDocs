# Run a scheduled job to generate an application model for business applications - Legacy

Execute a script to generate the application model for existing business applications. An application model is a structured representation of a business application's components and their relationships and interactions within your application landscape.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

In Enterprise Architecture, the application model is denoted by **Model ID** field for a business application. This model is important for creating the application model life cycle for a business application. For existing business applications, you can run the **CSDM Product Model Assignment** script to generate the Model ID.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; ** System Definition ** &gt; ** Scheduled Jobs**.

2.  Find and open the  scheduled job **CSDM Product Model Assignment**.

3.  Select  ** Execute Now**.


## Result

After executing the script, the system automatically creates models IDs for the existing business applications for which the **Model ID** field is empty.
