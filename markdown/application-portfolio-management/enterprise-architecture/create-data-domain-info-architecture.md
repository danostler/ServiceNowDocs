# Create a data domain - Legacy

A data domain is a collection of information objects. Relate an information object to the database catalog of a database instance to collect the physical data. ServiceNow Discovery finds the database catalog that lists all the catalog objects, or databases, discovered for an instance of a database.

## Before you begin

**Important:**

Starting with the Xanadu release, the data domains module is moved to the Enterprise Architecture Workspace. To learn more, see [Exploring data domains](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-portfolio-management/enterprise-architecture/eaw-data-domains.md) and [Manage data domains](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-portfolio-management/enterprise-architecture/eaw-manage-data-domains.md).

Role required: sn\_apm.apm\_user

Although an Enterprise Architecture user \(sn\_apm.apm\_user\) can create a data domain, the access control on the Data Domain \[sn\_apm\_data\_domain\] table is limited to its different users.

-   The Application Portfolio Analyst and Application Portfolio Administrator with sn\_apm.apm\_admin role have create, write, and delete privileges.
-   The Application Portfolio User with sn\_apm.apm\_user role has read access only.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Enterprise Architecture** &gt; **Information Portfolio** &gt; **Data Domains**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    For field information, see [Data Domain form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-portfolio-management/enterprise-architecture/data-domain-form.md).

4.  Select **Submit**.


## What to do next

Create an information object and link the data domain with the information object.
