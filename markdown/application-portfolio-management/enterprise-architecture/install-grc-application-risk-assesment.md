    Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) website to view all the available apps and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/store-release-notes/page/release-notes/store/sn-store-release-notes.html).

3.  Click **Install**.

4.  In the Application installation dialog box, review the application dependencies.

    Demo data comprises sample records that describe application features for common use cases. Load demo data when you first install the application on a development or test instance.

    **Important:** If you don't load the demo data during installation, it's unavailable to load later.

6.  Click **Install**.
