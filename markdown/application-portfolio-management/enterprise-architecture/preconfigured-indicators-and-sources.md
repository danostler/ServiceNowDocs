</table>**Note:** Ensure the following system properties are set to True for Incident and Change indicators.

-   To set the properties, navigate to All &gt; System Properties &gt; All Properties and search for the following properties:
    -   Populate Impacted Services based on Affected CIs \(com.snc.incident.refresh\_impacted.include\_affected\_cis\)
    -   Populate Business Application related list for incidents \(com.snc.incident.populate\_business\_application\)
    -   Populate the Business Application related list for change requests \(com.snc.change\_request.populate\_business\_application\)
-   To show up the **Impacted Business Applications** &gt; **Related List** &gt; **Additional actions** &gt; **Configure** &gt; **Related Lists** &gt; **Impacted Business Applications** &gt; **Available** &gt; **Selected** &gt; **Save**.
-   To see the impacted business applications for the **Number of Incidents via Service** and **Number of Changes via Service** indicators, you must refresh the **Impacted Services and CIs** related list for that record. For instructions, see [Refresh impacted services and CIs for Change](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/it-service-management/change-management/refresh-impacted-services-cis.md) and [Refresh impacted services and CIs for incident](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/it-service-management/incident-management/refresh-impacted-cis.md).

-   **[Performance Analytic indicators to measure application performance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-portfolio-management/enterprise-architecture/pa-indicators-jobs.md)**  
Use performance analytic \(PA\) indicators to know the count of incidents, problems, and changes logged against a business application and use this insight to improve the performance of your applications.
