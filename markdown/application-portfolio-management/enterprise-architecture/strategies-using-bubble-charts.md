# Analyze application scores in a bubble chart - Legacy

Bubble charts are interactive graphs that help you identify strategies by plotting application indicator scores. You can evaluate applications for a category and decide whether to invest, sustain, or to replace an application by configuring multiple combinations of indicators in the bubble chart.

## Before you begin

**Important:**

Starting with the Xanadu release, the bubble chart feature is moved to the Enterprise Architecture Workspace. To learn more, see [Bubble chart view of application rationalization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-portfolio-management/enterprise-architecture/eaw-bubble-chart-view.md).

Role required: sn\_apm.apm\_analyst

## About this task

Use the bubble chart to plot the indicator scores of the applications in X and Y axes. You can then use these scores to strategize goals and create a demand to invest in, replace, or sustain the application.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Enterprise Architecture** &gt; **Application Portfolio Analysis** &gt; **Analyze**.

    The Group Analysis page is displayed.

    The Group Analysis page has the following sections:

    -   **Assessment Period**

        The fiscal period for which the analysis of applications is done.

    -   **Filter Apps**

        Helps filter the application categories based on the criteria set on the application indicator scores.

    -   **Categories drop-down**

        Helps to filter application by groups such as Application Family, Application Category, and Capability.

2.  Select **Application Category** from the Category drop-down list.

    List of capabilities is displayed.

3.  Click an application category to open it.

    A bubble chart is opened for the application category. The bubble chart helps you to view the metrics of the application indicator scores that fall within the filtered values.

    Use the **Application Analysis** section to compare applications with the selected indicators. It shows the total score of the application rounded to two decimals, along with contract renewal details, its life-time details, and the different costs associated with the application. You can analyze to know which applications to invest further and that which are not really useful. To view the business application record details in the Business Application form, click the name of an application in the list. To view the application details in a dashboard view, click the [Application 360](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-portfolio-management/enterprise-architecture/applications-360-dashboard.md) tab in the Business Application form.

4.  To change the configurations of the bubble chart, click the configuration icon \(\) icon and then fill in the fields on the Select Chart Dimensions form.

    For field information, see [Select Chart Dimensions form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-portfolio-management/enterprise-architecture/select-chart-dimensions-form.md).


## What to do next

Point to the bubble in the chart and click the application or right-click the bubble and select **Create Demand** to [create a demand](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/application-portfolio-management/enterprise-architecture/create-an-idea.md) for the application.

Set up a bubble chart to compare and evaluate the relative standing of applications in selected categories. The chart helps you determine which applications to invest more in, keep, replace, or eliminate.
