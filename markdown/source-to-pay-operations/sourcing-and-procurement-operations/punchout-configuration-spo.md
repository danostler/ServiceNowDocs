# Punchout configuration in SPO

You must configure punchout for third-party suppliers.

The following configuration is required in SPO to enable punchout:

-   Enable suppliers for Punchout: Ensure that suppliers are enabled for Punchout. For each punchout supplier, a supplier record must be created, and the Punchout checkbox should be selected.
-   Configure the Third Party Registration table \(sn\_spend\_intg\_third\_party\_registration\): Depending on the type of integration, configure one the following configuration options:

    -   cXML Punchout: If the record is marked for cXML Punchout support, the cXML Punchout Setup related list allows you to configure various connection details.
    -   API Exchange: If the record is marked for API Exchange, the API Configuration related list provides options for setting up API-based integration with Punchout systems.
    -   SpendInt API: If the record is marked for SpendInt API, configuration options for data load are available. This supports pre-Punchout configuration for integrations.
