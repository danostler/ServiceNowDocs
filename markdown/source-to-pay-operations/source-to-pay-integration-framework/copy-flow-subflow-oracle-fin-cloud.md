5.  Activate the flow or subflow.

    -   Make sure that the flow or subflow is available and activated on the base system.
    -   Activate the copied flow after making the required changes.
6.  Use the **Trigger Condition** for the flow or subflow.

    This flow or subflow is triggered and associated with the purchase order when the following conditions are met:

    -   **Legal entity . ERP source . Active** is **true**.
    -   **Legal entity . ERP source . ERP Source** is **not empty**.
    -   **Status** is **Pending Submission**
    **Note:** Do not modify the trigger condition.

    **Note:** Once data is pulled into staging tables, transform maps move data into target tables. For more details, refer to [Source-to-Pay integration framework transform maps and subflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/source-to-pay-operations/source-to-pay-integration-framework/s2p-transform-maps-flows.md)

    You have successfully copied and executed the flow.
