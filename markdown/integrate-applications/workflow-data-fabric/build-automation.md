# Build automation

Use the requirement diagram to build an automation.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ac.automation\_technical\_user, playbook.write, playbook.activity\_def\_read, connection\_admin, or cmdb\_read

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Automation Center Workspace**.

2.  On the **Lists** tab \(\[Omitted image "autocenter-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: List icon\), under **Build**, select **All Automation Requests**.

3.  Select an automation request for which you want to build an automation.

4.  Select **Build Automation**.

    The **Select Instance** dialog box is displayed.

    **Important:** The **Build Automation** button is available only when the automation request is in the **In progress** state.

5.  Select an instance where you want to create an automation.

    **Note:** The instances that are set up will be available in the list. For more information, see [Set up connections and credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/integrate-applications/workflow-data-fabric/set-connection-alias.md).

6.  Select **Continue**.

    The **Build automation** window is displayed.

There are two options:-   **Build using diagram**: Building automation using diagram creates an end-to-end automation flow, transforming each diagram step into a corresponding automation placeholder step.
-   **Build manually**: Building automation manually does not use the diagram. It lets you create a fresh automation.

</table>8.  Select **Build Automation**.

    The requirement diagram is visible from the Workflow Studio.

    For more information about editing or creating diagrams, see .

    At this point you must create a trigger to activate the automation.

    **Note:** When the new automation request is created, an automation with the same name is created and mapped to the automation request.
