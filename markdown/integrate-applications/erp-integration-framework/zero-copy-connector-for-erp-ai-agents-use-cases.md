</table>**Important:** By default, all agentic workflows and AI agent records are read-only.

Looking for an AI agent?

-   There might be AI agents installed with the Now Assist application that are not used in agentic workflows. To learn how to see all agents that are available on your instance, see [Find AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/intelligent-experiences/enable-ai-experiences/find-ai-agents.md).
-   To find agents that might not be installed on your instance, visit the [AI Agent Marketplace](https://store.servicenow.com/store/ai-marketplace) on the ServiceNow Store.

## Role masking

Required role: sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin.

[Role masking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/intelligent-experiences/enable-ai-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) enables users to limit the roles and privileges of AI agents during tool execution. AI agents that get installed with Now Assist applications are assigned pre-defined roles. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. Data access settings must also include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/intelligent-experiences/enable-ai-experiences/define-sec-controls-aia.md).
