# Zero Copy Connector for ERP data products

Use Zero Copy Connector for ERP data products \(formerly named ERP content packs\) as examples to help you implement and deploy applications with less manual work.

**Note:** Currently, data products work only with SAP systems.

Zero Copy Connector for ERP data products are sets of predefined models and process extensions that are useful examples for developers with little or no SAP domain knowledge. For instance, you're integrating a ServiceNow application with SAP, but it's taking a long time because of the complexity of the SAP data. Data products accelerate the work so that building uses cases involving SAP data becomes a faster process that more developers can accomplish.

After installing a data product, the models it contains are listed on the Zero Copy Connector for ERP models page with a prefix of **DP**. The process extensions in the data product are listed on the **Subflows** tab in Workflow Studio with a prefix of **ERP DP**.

Data product models and process extensions are examples. Use them as accelerators that can be tailored to your requirements. The models and process extensions can't be edited, but can be viewed. If you see a model similar to the integration you're trying to create, clone the model, give it a unique name, and edit it as needed. If you find a process extension you want to use, copy, rename, and edit the models it contains as needed.
