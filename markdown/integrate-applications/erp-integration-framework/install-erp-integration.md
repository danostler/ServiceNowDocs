## What to do next

An admin or a user with the sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin role must enable the **sn\_erp\_integration.enableModelModification** property for you to edit, customize, and clone ERP models and tables. After enabling the **sn\_erp\_integration.enableModelModification** property, Zero Copy Connector for ERP retrieves all tables and BAPIs \(Business Application Programming Interface\) to use when managing models.The property must be configured for either a non-production or production state. \(Enabling the **sn\_erp\_integration.enableModelModification** on a production instance can create metadata records when new models and fields are added in Zero Copy Connector for ERP.\) System properties are maintained in the System Property table \[sys\_properties\], which you can access by entering `sys_properties.list` directly in the Navigator Filter.

**Note:** You must enable the **sn\_erp\_integration.enableModelModification** property on the correct scope.
