# Create a schedule on the robot calendar in RPA Hub

Create a schedule on the **Robot Calendar** tab in RPA Hub to execute unattended robots. You can also identify any conflicts in the schedule by selecting the **Preview** button.

## Before you begin

Perform the following tasks before you create a schedule on the robot calendar:

-   Ensure you are familiar with robot calendar concepts. For more information, see [Using the robot calendar for RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/integrate-applications/rpa-hub/robot-calendar-rpa.md) and [View current robot events in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/integrate-applications/rpa-hub/view-robot-calendar.md).
-   Create an unattended robot. On the robot form, ensure that you select the **Robot Type** field as **Unattended**. For more information, see [Creating an attended or an unattended robot in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/integrate-applications/rpa-hub/create-robot.md).
-   Establish the robot connection to an unattended bot process. For more information, see [Assign a robot to a bot process in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/integrate-applications/rpa-hub/assign-robots.md).
-   Verify that the life-cycle stage of the associated bot process isn’t set to **Retired**.
-   Ensure that the RPA developer \(sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_developer\) or the RPA support user \(sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_support\_user\) are in the Managed by Group list of the associated bot process.

Role required: sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_release\_manager, sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_developer, sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_support\_user, or sn\_rpa\_fdn.rpa\_admin
