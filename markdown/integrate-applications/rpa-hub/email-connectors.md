# Email connector

The Email connector lets an RPA Desktop Design Studio automation work with email. For example, an automation can send, retrieve, and reply to email messages, and can automatically download attachments.

**Note:** The Email connector works only with IMAP mail servers, including Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo! Mail, and many others. It is not possible to access Gmail at this time.

In this example automation, the SetConfig method of the Email connector logs in to the mail server using the account holder's credentials. The GetMail method then retrieves all the unread messages from the inbox of the account. By using a For Each loop, the automation iterates through the retrieved messages and saves each message's attachments to a specified location on the local drive.
