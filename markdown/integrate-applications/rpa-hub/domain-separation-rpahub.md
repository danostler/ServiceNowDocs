# Domain separation and Robotic Process Automation \(RPA\) Hub

Domain separation is supported for RPA Hub. Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data.

## Support level: Basic



-   Business logic: Ensure that data goes into the proper domain for the application’s service provider use cases.
-   The application supports domain separation at run time. The domain separation includes separation from the user interface, cache keys, reporting, rollups, and aggregations.
-   The owner of the instance must set up the application to function across multiple tenants.

Sample use case: When a service provider \(SP\) uses chat to respond to a tenant-customer’s message, the customer must be able to see the SP's response.

For more information on support levels, see Application support for domain separation.

## Domain separation overview

The goal of RPA Hub is to enable end-to-end automation for your organization. Domain separation is enabled in all the features.

You should have either a flat hierarchy or a single-tier hierarchy and at least one primary or top-level domain.
