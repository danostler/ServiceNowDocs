# Re-evaluate license distribution by executing RPA scripts

Run the Robotic Process Automation \(RPA\) script on demand to validate and unlock the robots in a domain and its child domains.

## Before you begin

Familiarise with license distribution in RPA Hub concepts. For more information, see [Robot license distribution in RPA Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/integrate-applications/rpa-hub/license-rpa-hub.md).

To unlock the robots in a domain, ensure that the license entitlement and consumption is compliant.

A schedule script runs every 12 hours to evaluate the utilized robots.

You must do this task in the classic environment.

Role required: rpa\_admin

## About this task

An RPA script is a scheduled job that is executed on demand.
