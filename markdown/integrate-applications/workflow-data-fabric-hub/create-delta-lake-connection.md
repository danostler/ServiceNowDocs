# Create a Delta Lake connection

Establish a zero copy connection to Delta Lake in Workflow Data Fabric Hub.

## Before you begin

Role required: df\_connection\_admin

## About this task

Work with your data source admin to create a connection to Delta Lake. For additional information about connecting, refer to the [Delta Lake connector documentation](https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/delta-lake.html).

**Note:** This connector was developed by the open-source community and made available through the ServiceNow AI Platform for general use. Functionality can vary and might not cover all use cases supported by primary connectors.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the available community connectors in Workflow Data Fabric Hub in one of the following ways:

    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workflow Data Fabric Hub** &gt; **Available connectors** &gt; **Community connectors**.
    -   Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Workflow Data Fabric Hub** &gt; **Available connectors** &gt; **Community connectors**.
2.  Find the Delta Lake connector and select **Connect**.

3.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name and description|
    |Connection label|Unique name for this connection. This helps in identifying the connection within your system.|
    |Connection name|System-generated name based on the Connection label. This field cannot be modified once the connection is established.|
    |Short description|Description of the connection explaining what it is about.|
    |Object storage authentication|
    |Object storage system|Storage system used. Default is Amazon S3.|
    |AWS access key|Access key used to access S3.|
    |AWS secret key|Secret key used to access S3.|
    |AWS region|AWS region where your S3 bucket is located.|

4.  Configure the metastore that you want to use with Delta Lake.

## Result

A test connection is made to the external data source, verifying that the connection details are correct and the data source is accessible.

## What to do next

If the connection succeeds, configure data steward access on the **Access Control** tab. See [Manage access to an established connection using roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/integrate-applications/workflow-data-fabric-hub/manage-access-connection-wdf.md).

If the connection fails, verify the connection details with your data source administrator and try again.
