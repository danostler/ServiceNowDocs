# View data assets from an established connection

    -   Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workflow Data Fabric Hub** &gt; **Established connections**.
    -   Navigate to **Admin** &gt; **Workflow Data Fabric Hub** &gt; **Established connections**.
2.  Select the connection with data assets that you want to view.

3.  Select the **Data Assets** tab.

4.  Browse or search for available data assets in the schema explorer.

5.  View the data fabric tables that are currently mapped to a source table.

    1.  Select a source table in the schema explorer.

    2.  Select the **Data fabric tables** sub-tab.

6.  View the available columns in a source table.

    1.  Select a source table in the schema explorer.
