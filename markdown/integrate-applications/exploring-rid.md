# Exploring Requirement Intake Diagram

Learn about the Requirement Intake Diagram application key features, flow, and workspace.

## Requirement Intake Diagram overview

Use Requirement Intake Diagram to design the automation requirements visually. The diagram provides a way to visualize the complete requirements, which depend on different departments and involve multiple activities. Once the diagram is created, it will be translated into a detailed Playbook process, which can then be configured and executed as actual running automation.

</table>## Requirement Intake Diagram flow

The following diagram shows the flow of the Requirement Intake Diagram. Users with sn\_ac.automation\_business\_user, playbook.activity\_def\_read, and playbook.write roles request a requirement diagram. Users with sn\_ac.automation\_technical\_user, playbook.activity\_def\_read, and playbook.write roles create a requirement diagram, translate it into a Playbook process, and eventually creates the automation.

\[Omitted image "rid-flow.png"\] Alt text: This image describes the flow of how a diagram is requested, created, and then translated to a Playbook process, and then an automation.

1.  The requester or business user creates an automation request from Automation Center.
2.  After saving the request, the fulfiller or technical user gets a review request for the automation request.
3.  The fulfiller or technical user checks if the requirement diagram is available.

    If the diagram is not available, the fulfiller or technical user sends a request to the requester or business user to create a requirement diagram.

4.  If the diagram is available, the fulfiller or technical user starts creating the automation in the Workflow Studio using Playbook.
