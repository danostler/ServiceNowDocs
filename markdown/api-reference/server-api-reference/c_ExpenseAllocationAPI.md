# ExpenseAllocation- Global

The ExpenseAllocation script include is used by various cost management processes and can also be used for generating custom expense allocation records \(fm\_expense\_allocation\) from scripted expense allocation rules.

This script include requires the Cost Management \(com.snc.cost\_management\) plugin.
