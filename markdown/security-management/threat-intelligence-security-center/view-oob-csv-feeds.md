SSLBL collects IP addresses that are running with an SSL certificate blacklisted on SSLBL. These are usually botnet Command&amp;Control servers \(C&amp;C\). SSLBL hence publishes a blacklist containing these IPs which can be used to detect botnet C2 traffic from infected machines towards the internet, leaving your network.|[https://sslbl.abuse.ch/blacklist/sslipblacklist.csv](https://sslbl.abuse.ch/blacklist/sslipblacklist.csv)|
