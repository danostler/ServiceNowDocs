# Configure and enable Have I Been Pwned integration

Configure API credentials and enrichment behavior through the dedicated Have I Been Pwned \(HIBP\) configuration tile in TISC integration settings.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_sec\_tisc.admin

**Prerequisites**

-   The Have I Been Pwned integration depends on the Threat Intelligence Security Center \(TISC\) application. To enrich email and domain observables, ensure that the TISC plugin \(`sn_sec_tisc`\) is installed.
-   Obtain a valid API key from the Have I Been Pwned portal before you begin.

## About this task

The HIBP integration is an observable enrichment integration that determines whether a submitted email address or domain name has been part of a publicly known data breach.

When an analyst submits a supported observable, the integration queries the HIBP database and returns breach details, including the total number of breaches found and the type of data compromised.

The integration supports the following observable types:

-   Email address
-   Domain name

## Procedure

1.  Using your instance, access **Threat Intelligence Security Center**.

2.  [Download the integration from the ServiceNow Store](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/security-management/download-app-first-time.md).

3.  When the installation is complete, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Threat Intelligence Security Center**.

4.  Select **Integrations** &gt; **Enrichment Integrations** &gt; **All Integrations**.

5.  Alternatively, you can navigate to **Integrations** &gt; **Enrichment Integrations** &gt; **All Integrations** &gt; **Observable Enrichment**.

6.  Select **Configure New Enrichment**.

7.  Select the integration.

    For example, Have I Been Pwned to configure the HIBP integration.

8.  Fill in the fields on the Configure New Enrichment form.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |**Enrichment Integration**|
    |Name|Enter a name for the new enrichment integration. For example, Have I Been Pwned.|
    |Integration Category|Indicates the integration category that you selected.|
    |Vendor Name|Name of the vendor. The details of the selected vendor is populated by default. For example, Have I Been Pwned.|
    |Integration Type|Type of integration that you selected.|
    |Description|Enter the description for the new enrichment integration.|
    |**Integration Configuration**|
    |API Key|Indicates the API key that you obtained from the Have I Been Pwned site.|

9.  Drill down to the **Integration Configuration** section.

10. Enter \(or paste\) the **API Key** you acquired from the Have I Been Pwned site.

11. Click **Save**.

    The integration details are validated, and by default the Have I Been Pwned integration status is set to disabled.

12. Click **Enable** to enable the Have I Been Pwned integration.

    **Important:** Only one Have I Been Pwned integration tile can exist per instance. Attempting to create a second tile results in an error.


## Result

After it is configured, Have I Been Pwned can be selected for performing enrichment on observables in Threat Intelligence Security Center.

## What to do next

Run observable enrichment, see [Run Have I Been Pwned enrichment integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/security-management/threat-intelligence-security-center/tisc-hibp-enrichment-integration.md) on the detailed procedure.
