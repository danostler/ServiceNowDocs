Select the check box to choose a different Integration script and Report Processor. Make sure the chosen scripts are compatible with the selected TAXII version. Based on the TAXII version and authentication, these scripts are auto populated by default.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Integration script

</td><td>

Invokes a call to the REST Endpoint URL API using the authentication parameters such as authentication type: User name/Password/API Key and the headers to be passed with the request, and then the script fetches the observables or indicators STIX data that are available for the specific feed.**Note:** The data that is fetched is the raw data only \(no records are created\) which will be attached to the integration process and can then be viewed under the **Integration Run** section.

Within the base system following are the custom scripts includes, which are provisioned within the application for the integrations scripts:

-   TAXIIV2\_0QueryParamAPIKeyIntegrationScript
-   TAXIIV2\_0BasicAuthIntegrationScript
-   TAXIIV2\_1QueryParamAPIKeyIntegrationScript
-   TAXIIV2\_1BasicAuthIntegrationScript
The default integration script is based on the feed type that you select. The script includes runs a simple REST call, saves the response as an attachment, and then returns the attachment to the processor.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Report processor

</td><td>

The report processor invokes a call to the REST Endpoint URL.Within the base system below is the custom scripts includes, which is provisioned within the application for the integrations scripts, **TAXIIV2CollectionDataProcessor**.

Expiry period \(days\)

</td><td>

Defines the number of days after which the collections records received from the TAXII server will expire.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Run Frequency of Collections

</td><td>

Set the frequency at which you want to fetch the records from TAXII server. The TAXII feed will run and execute based on the scheduling job interval. The available job intervals are:-   Daily
-   Weekly
-   Monthly
-   Periodically
-   Once
-   On Demand
-   Business Calendar: Entry Start
-   Business Calendar: Entry End
**Note:** By default, the frequency is set to **On Demand**. For more information, see Scheduled Jobs and how to Automatically run a script of your choosing.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Override Source Expiration

</td><td>

When enabled, the feed or collections record received will have its expiration time overridden to match the profile’s configuration.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Confidence

</td><td>

This indicates the default confidence level assigned to TAXII feeds or collections received from this profile when the source does not specify a confidence value.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Run Frequency of Collections

</td><td>

The scheduling interval which will be applied to the TAXII collection records. Run frequency for a TAXII collection can be modified in the TAXII collection form view if required.**Note:** This setting will be applied as default to all the TAXII collections that are fetched. There is an option to override the setting in TAXII Collections if required.

 For more information, see Scheduled Jobs and how to Automatically run a script of your choosing.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Fetch Data From

</td><td>

The start date from when the data needed to be fetched. This field should be set with the time from when the data needs to be ingested from the corresponding source. Once this field is set, the next ingestion run would fetch the data from the configured time and consecutive ingestion runs would fetch incremental Data.For example, Source is scheduled to ingest the data every hour. The user sets **Fetch Data From** to Jan 12 6:00AM on Jan 12 9:30AM, the ingestion triggering on Jan 12 10:00AM would fetch the data from Jan 12 6:00AM to Jan 12 10:00AM. The next ingestion that triggers at 11:00AM would fetch only the incremental data from Jan 12 10:00AM to Jan 12 11:00AM.

**Note:** This means the scheduled runs will fetch data incrementally starting from the specified date onwards.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>6.  Click **Validate Connection**

    An information message is displayed that the TAXII Feed connection is successful. To fetch the collections proceed to the next step.

7.  Click **Get TAXII Collections**.

    **Note:** If there are any errors, then an error message is displayed that an error occurred while fetching TAXII collections and check logs for more details.

    The TAXII Collections are displayed under the TAXII Collections section, and they are disabled by default.

8.  Enable the TAXII Collections to retrieve the STIX objects available in these TAXII collections.
