# Configure Observable Enrichment

You can perform threat intelligence enrichment on one or more observables to determine whether they’re associated with known security threats. The implementations that run depend on the ones you’ve activated.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_sec\_tisc.admin

The Threat Intelligence Security Center supports Observable Enrichment only for the WHOIS Integration as of now. For more information, see [Configure and enable Whois integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/security-management/threat-intelligence-security-center/tisc-whoisxml-api-integration.md).

**Note:** Enrichment Integrations module is only shown if at least one of the integration supporting any of the capability is installed in the application.

## About this task

The Observable Enrichment section contains only the integrations with the integration type as observable enrichment. This section displays cards for each of the configured integration implementations that you can activate and use.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Threat Intelligence Security Center**.

2.  Click the **Integrations** icon, and select the **Observable Enrichment** section.

3.  Click the **Configure new enrichment** action.

    This takes you to the pop-up that displays the available integrations. You need to choose the integration that you need to configure.

4.  Select an integration from the list of available integrations, and click **Select**.

    This takes you to the Create New Enrichment Integration page of the selected integration. This page is pre-filled with details of the selected integration by default. For example, WHOIS integration.

5.  On the Create New Integration form, fill the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |**Enrichment Integration**| |
    |**Name**|Enter a name for the new enrichment integration. For example, `WHOIS1`.|
    |**Vendor Name**|Name of the vendor. The details of the selected vendor is pre-filled by default. For example, `WHOIS`.|
    |**Integration Type**|Type of integration that you selected, which is Observable Enrichment. The details of the selected integration type is pre-filled by default.|
    |**Description**|Enter a unique description for the new enrichment integration.|

6.  In the Integration Configuration section, configure the integration details based on your requirements.

    The Integration Configuration section includes configuration details like API key, API Client ID or secret, username, password, and so on, which you need to fill in. These configuration details vary for different apps.

7.  Click the **Save** action to store and create the new enrichment integration configuration.

    After you click the **Save** or **Enable** action, the integration is validated using the provided integration configurations. By default, the enrichment integration's status is set to disabled.

8.  Click **Save as Draft** action to only store the updates made to the enrichment configuration and not create it.

    If you're not sure about the configuration details, you can use the **Save as Draft** option. After you get the configuration details, you can fill the remaining information in the draft version and create it.

9.  To enable the enrichment integration, click **Enable**.

    The enrichment integration is enabled successfully. You can also enable, disable, or delete a particular enrichment integration by using the Actions menu of the required integration tile on the Catalog page or the Enrichment Integrations page.

The Have I Been Pwned \(HIBP\) integration enables you to enrich email address and domain observables with breach data directly within the TISC.
-   **[Whois integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/security-management/threat-intelligence-security-center/tisc-whoisxml-integration.md)**  
The Whois integration enables you to submit Whois lookups on domain names and URLs to obtain context on URL observables, and to make better determination on threats.
