# Define an Observable

Observables can be retrieved from scheduled feed ingestion or from the import assistant. However, you can create observables, as needed.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_sec\_tisc.analyst

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Threat Intelligence Security Center** &gt; **Threat Intel Library** &gt; **Observables** &gt; **All Observables**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Select the **Observable Type**.

    **Note:** When you create records for observables, indicators, entities, or objects, a source record is created and a prompt message appears that the new object record is created. You are then redirected to the aggregated record.

4.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    **Note:** When you create a new observable or view existing observables, the **Attachments** pane appears by default on the form view. You can select the Attachments icon on the right-contextual menu or go to **Preferences** &gt; **Workspaces** and disable **Show the sidebar**. For more information, see Configure Next Experience Workspace preferences.

    |-----|-----------|
    |Resolves To|List of references to one or more IP addresses or domain names that the domain name resolves to.|
    |Is FQDN|Fully qualified domain name \(FQDN\) is the complete address of an internet host or computer. It provides its exact location within the domain name system \(DNS\) by specifying the hostname, domain name, and top-level domain \(TLD\).|

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Threat Level|Threat level of the observable record.|
    |First Seen|Time that this observable record was first seen performing malicious activities.|

    |Attack Phases|Attack phase in a kill chain such as LM, MITRE ATT&amp;CK.|
    |Additional Context|Any additional context.|
    |Sources|Threat source from which this record is created.|

    **Important:** **Source Reported Score**: This field contains the aggregated value of threat scores reported by the sources from which the observable is ingested. To see this field on the observable record form, you must add it manually, as it isn't available by default.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Resolves To|List of references to one or more IP addresses or domain names that the domain name resolves to.|
    |Is FQDN|Fully qualified domain name \(FQDN\) is the complete address of an internet host or computer. It provides its exact location within the domain name system \(DNS\) by specifying the hostname, domain name, and top-level domain \(TLD\).|

    **Note:** **Resolves To** and **Is FQDN** attributes are only applicable to the **Domain Name** type of observables.

5.  Select **Save**.

    After you save, a prompt message appears indicating that a new observable record is created. Select **Continue** to edit the record and create new relationships.

6.  To delete any observable record, select **Delete** to delete the aggregated record.

    When you select this action, it removes all the related records, except the original source data, and triggers reaggregation.

    **Note:** A confirmation message appears to verify that you want to delete the aggregated record. To also delete the source records and prevent reaggregation, select the **Delete Source Records** check box. This action removes all the associated source records.

7.  Select **Continue**.

    **Important:** After you create a new observable record, the **Prevent System Updates** check box appears.

    Select this check box to prevent any updates from the system after the observable, indicator, or STIX objects records are created.

3.  You can add observables to cases. For more information, see [Add to Case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/security-management/threat-intelligence-security-center/add-to-case.md).
4.  You can also run enrichment actions to observables. For more information, see [Run Enrichment Actions within a case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/security-management/threat-intelligence-security-center/run-enrichment-results.md).
