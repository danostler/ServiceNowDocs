# Attachments not appearing after import

If attachments are not appearing as expected for data sources or on a security incident after third-party integration imports, check your IP restrictions.

IP access restrictions can prevent attachments from being seen unless you are logged in from a safe IP. Since a new attachment is added with each import, this can result in duplicates you have to remove.

For example, when you run a third-party host import integration, if you do not see any attachments on your data sources, check your IP restrictions and add users to the safe list prior to import.
