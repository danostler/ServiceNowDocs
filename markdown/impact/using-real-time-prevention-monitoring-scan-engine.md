# Real-time prevention monitoring for Scan Engine

Real-Time Prevention is a Scan Engine feature that actively monitors records as they are created or modified by developers and administrators, displaying real-time finding messages when saving records in any instance where the Scan Engine is installed and activated.

How it works:

-   **Immediate Detection:** Identifies potential violations in scripts, includes, and other fields at the moment of edit.
-   **On-Screen Alerts:** Displays findings in real-time with severity levels
-   **Guided Resolution:** Provides details, such as line numbers, impact levels, and steps to resolve found issues.
-   **Governance:** Supports exception workflows and links to supporting documentation for compliance.

**Note:** Real-Time Prevention must be enabled in the Scan Engine properties page for this feature to function. For more information, refer to [Configure Scan Engine properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/impact/configure-scan-engine-properties.md).

Findings identified by real-time monitoring can have the following levels.
