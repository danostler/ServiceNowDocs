# Syncing exception reasons

Exception reasons are automatically synchronized to the Production instance whenever they are created or updated, based on the instances specified in the **My SN Instances** table.

If you selected **Enable approvals in production** on the **Exception reason** properties tab on the Production instance, then once the exception reason changes to the **Requested** state, approval requests trigger for the **Approval Group\(s\)** field. Once the exception reason is approved or rejected, the status syncs back to the Developer instance.
