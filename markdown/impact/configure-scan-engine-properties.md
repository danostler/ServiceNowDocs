# Configure Scan Engine properties

Configure the primary scanning capabilities and configuration options for scheduled, on-demand and real-time scans.

## Before you begin

[Run your first scan with the Scan Engine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/impact/run-scan-engine.md) to run your initial scan.

Role required: Scan Engine admin and Impact admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **ALL** &gt; **Impact** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Scan Engine Properties**.

2.  Select **Activate Scan Engine** to ensure the Scan Engine runs against your instance.

3.  Select **Run Scheduled Scan** to schedule nightly, weekly, or monthly scans, and then configure the following options.

**Run**

</td><td>

Daily, Weekly, or Monthly scheduled scan run times.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d26583e117">

**Day of Week**

</td><td>

The day of the week on which to run weekly scans.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d26583e126">

**Day of Month**

</td><td>

The day of the month on which to run monthly scans.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d26583e135">

**Time Zone**

</td><td>

Your time zone.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d26583e145">

**Time**

</td><td>

-   Field type = `glide_utc_time`
-   The time the scan should begin in 24-hour format \(HH:MM:SS\).


</td></tr></tbody>

**Scan Non-Configuration Records**

</td><td>

Includes non-configuration tables \(which do not extend `sys_metadata`\) in the scan.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d26583e195">

**Scan Read-Only Records**

</td><td>

-   Includes read-only records in the scan.
-   `scan_read_only`: Default value is `true`.
-   Read-only records are scanned by default.


</td></tr><tr><td id="d26583e221">

**Track Resolved Findings**

</td><td>

Logs any resolved findings as part of the scan and includes them in the View Resolved Findings module of the dashboard.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d26583e230">

**Scan Findings Limit**

</td><td>

-   Field name: `scan_findings_limit`
-   The maximum number of findings that can be generated for each definition during a scan.
-   The limit is applied per applicable table. For example, if the limit is set to 100, a maximum of 100 findings will be generated for each applicable table.
-   Prevents excessive or redundant findings and optimizes scan performance.


</td></tr><tr><td id="d26583e257">

**Custom Workday**

</td><td>

By default, technical debt is calculated as a 24-hour day, which allows you to specify a number of hours for a workday. For example, developer workdays can be set to 8 hours instead of 24.**Note:** This is used to calculate various metrics that appear in the Analytics Dashboards.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d26583e268">

**Average hourly rate of development**

</td><td>

This figure calculates the cost of technical debt that displays on your dashboard by multiplying it by the estimated time to resolve each finding in the system.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d26583e277">

**Batch Record Size**

</td><td>

-   Field name: `full_scan_batch_size`
-   Default value = 50,000 records.
-   Specifies the maximum number of records allowed to be analyzed in a single batch scan for an applicable table.
-   This value does not limit the total number of records that can be scanned. When a table's record count exceeds this threshold \(50,000\), the table is assigned to its own dedicated batch during scan processing to optimize performance.
-   This value determines when an applicable table warrants its own batch during scans.

**Note:** This is a read-only system property that cannot be modified through the UI.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d26583e308">

**Scheduled Scan Logging Frequency**

</td><td>

-   Default value = `false`
-   Leave blank to disable verbose logging. When set, logs scan progress after processing the specified number of records


</td></tr><tr><td id="d26583e328">

**Days of scan finding histories to keep**

</td><td>

-   Field name: `keep_days_finding_history`
-   Sets the retention period for finding history records.

**Note:** This controls how long historical scan data is retained, not the findings themselves.The default value is 30 days.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d26583e350">

**Include review findings in technical debt**

</td><td>

Displays findings on the dashboard where the level of the rule is equal to Review.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d26583e360">

**Enable instance specific definitions**

</td><td>

-   Field name: `instance_specific_definitions`
-   Select to restrict scan definitions to run only on designated instances.
-   When disabled, all active definitions run on all instances.
-   When enabled without matching instances, only 'All Instances' definitions execute.

**Note:** Configuration option that controls whether definitions run only on specified instances.

**Scan Out Of Box Records**

</td><td>

-   Field name: `scan_out_of_box_records`
-   Default value = `false`
-   Includes ServiceNow base system records in full scans \(scheduled, on-demand, and limited definition scans\).
-   Creates finding records for base system records.

**Note:** This setting does not apply to real-time scans or update set scans, where base system records are always scanned.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d26583e425">

**Scan Non-Configuration Records**

</td><td>

-   Field name: `scan_non_configuration_records`
-   Default value = `true`
