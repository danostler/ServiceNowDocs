# Test your Virtual Agent API configuration

Test your Virtual Agent API configuration using API testing tool.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have setup Postman or Swagger or any other third-party application environment for API testing.

Role required: admin

## About this task

API tests are a way to verify that your API is behaving as you expect it to. To write a test, do the following:

## Procedure

1.  Select the environment that you have setup and navigate to tab where you can send your first API request.

2.  Configure the payload.

    For example, send the following request:

    ```
    {
        "requestId": "requestid123",
        "userId": "testuser.1",
        "emailId": "admin@example.com",
        "action": "START_CONVERSATION",
        "message": {
            "text": "",
            "typed": true
        },
        "contextVariables": {
            "app_name": "test"
        }
    }
    ```

3.  Select **Send**.

    You can check the response of your payload and your communication status in the response section.

    -   If your instance is on asynchronous mode, you have to check enabling Virtual Agent API logging.
    -   If your instance is on synchronous mode, you have to check the Body of the response.
