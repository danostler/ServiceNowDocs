# Add NLU to an existing keyword topic

Create and map an NLU model group and intent for the topic from Virtual Agent Designer.

## Before you begin

[Configure NLU on the instance in Virtual Agent General Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/configure-nlu-settings.md).

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Conversational Interfaces** &gt; **Virtual Agent** &gt; **Designer**.

2.  Open an existing topic.

3.  Select the **Properties** tab.

4.  In the **NLU Model** field, do one of the following:

    **Note:** If the **NLU model** field does not appear and you have Now Assist enabled, ensure that you haven't selected an LLM topic. Navigate back to the Topics page and select a topic that has the **Model Type** set to **NLU/Keywords**.

    -   Choose an existing model.
    -   Select **Create Model** to create a new model group.

        1.  In the **Model Name** field, enter a name for the new model group.
        2.  In the **Intent name** field, accept the default value or enter a name for the new intent.
        **Note:** New models are created in **Draft** state.

5.  In the **Associated Intent** field, do one of the following:

    -   Choose an existing intent.
    -   Select **Create intent** to create a new intent.

        In the **Intent Name** field, accept the default value or enter a name for the new intent.

6.  In the **Keywords** field, enter key phrases or terms that users enter to initiate the conversation with the Virtual Agent.

    Press **Enter** after each phrase. Keywords are also used for languages that are currently not available in NLU.

7.  Select the **NLU Intent** tab, and then add utterances and associate entities with them.

    For more information about adding utterances, see Create an NLU intent. For more information about defining entities, see Entities.

8.  Make any other changes on the **Flow** tab, such as associating entities with a node or adding entities as input variables for the topic.

9.  When you're finished with the topic, select **Save** in the topic header bar.


## Result

The modified topic is in the inactive state until you publish it.
