# Reorder promoted LLM conversational subflows, actions, and topics

Rearrange LLM assets like conversational subflows, conversational actions, and topics to the desired order after promoting them for recommendation by the Virtual Agent.

## Before you begin

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

Promote the LLM assets that you want to reorder in Virtual Agent Designer. For more information on promoting assets, see [Promote or demote LLM conversational subflows, actions, and topics in Virtual Agent Designer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/conversational-interfaces/virtual-agent/promote-demote-va-topics.md)

## About this task

By default, promoted LLM assets are presented in alphabetical order in the assistant. You can rearrange promoted assets in any desired order by editing their records from the Promoted Skills \[sys\_cs\_context\_profile\_promoted\_skill\] table. When conditions are applied to a promoted asset, and when the asset meets the condition, then it is displayed first by the assistant, irrespective of its set order.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the Promoted Skills \[sys\_cs\_context\_profile\_promoted\_skill\] table by selecting **All** and entering `sys_cs_context_profile_promoted_skill.list` in the filter.

2.  For the LLM topic, conversational subflow, or conversational action that you want to reorder, select the **Order** value.

3.  In the **Order** field, enter the new order and select **Update**.

    In the assistant, the promoted skills will appear in the set order.

4.  To add a condition, in the **Condition** builder, enter the required parameters and select **Update**.

    \[Omitted image "reorder-add-condition-2.png"\] Alt text: Add condition.

    In the assistant, the conditionally promoted skill will appear before the other assets.


## Result

The list of promoted assets is presented in a Virtual Agent conversation based on the Order value of each asset and the conditions applied.

## What to do next

Repeat the previous steps to adjust any other promoted assets to sort them in a preferred order.
