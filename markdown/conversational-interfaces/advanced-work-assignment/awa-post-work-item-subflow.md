# AWA post work item subflow

Configure the base system AWA post work item subflow by defining the input in Workflow Studio.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  On the Workflow Studio screen, select **Subflows**.

3.  In the Name column, enter `Template: AWA post work item`.

    This searches for the Template: AWA post work item.

4.  Select **Template: AWA post work item**.

5.  In the subflow header, select the more actions icon \(\[Omitted image "awa-more-actions.png"\] Alt text: More actions icon\) and then **Copy subflow.**

6.  On the Create a copy of this subflow dialog, enter a unique and descriptive name for the copied subflow in the **New subflow name** field.

7.  Select **Copy**.

    The new subflow is created and displays as a tab in the subflow designer editor.

8.  You can customize the subflow by doing one of the following:

    -   Integrate with a third-party system by adding an action with a spoke from the Integration Hub \(for more information, see Spokes\)
    -   Use a REST action step and call the external endpoint \(for more information, see REST step\).
    -   Call a REST message in the subflow itself \(for more information, see Outbound REST Web Service\).
