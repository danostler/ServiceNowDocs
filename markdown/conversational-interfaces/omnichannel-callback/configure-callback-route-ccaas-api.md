# Configure callback routing

Configure callback requests to route them to the external CCaaS providers using Callback Actions API.

## About this task

To send callback requests to the external CCaaS providers, you have to define routing rules in the **Callback routing configuration** table. While defining it, you can control when to apply routing, which group it is going to affect, and what subflow to use to process the outbound request.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you have copied the External Callback Operations template in Subflows. To learn more, see [Copy subflow template for callback routing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/zurich/markdown/zurich/conversational-interfaces/omnichannel-callback/configure-callback-route-copy-subflow-template.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **sys\_cs\_callback\_routing\_config.LIST**.
